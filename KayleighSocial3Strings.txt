Hey, uh, do you wanna come on over to my place? I have something I wanted to show you.
	Sure!
	Not now.
		No problem – I guess I have more time to practice then!
Brilliant!
I-I wanted to play you something. My dad used to sing this to me, and it was the first song I ever learned to play.
You've been wonderful to me, and I wanted to do a little something for you.
Are you ready?
	Yeah!
So, what did you think?
	That was amazing!
		Aw, don’t go making me blush now!
			I hope you keep playing.

			I think I want to kiss you right now.

	I think I want to kiss you right now.
		Aw, you sure it's not just the magical effect of seeing a guitarist at work?
		I got my first girl crush seeing a friend play drums in a band when we were in college. I think I just fall for musicians easily.
			Joking aside, I do hope you continue to play!

I…
If you want to kiss me…
I think now would be a good time.

So do I! Maybe we should write a song together, whilst out on our travels? 
Sounds like a wee bit of fun, doesn’t it?
I’m game!
Then it’s settled! Let’s do it!
