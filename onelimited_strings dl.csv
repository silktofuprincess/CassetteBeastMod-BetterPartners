kayleigh_awkward.png,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_1,It's OK! It's not like you promised me anything exclusive. We just had a cute moment or two together. That's all.
kayleigh_thinking,kayleigh_sigh_2,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_2,"I get what you see in her. All in all, she's dead-on."
,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_3,"She's smart, and strong, and knows who she is and what she stands for, and doesn't try to hide or apologize for it."
kayleigh_happy.png,kayleigh_laugh_1,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_4,"Easy on the eyes, too."
,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_5,"But [wave amp=20 freq=10]maybe[/wave] we should keep that between us. If Meredith knew how I felt about her, I can't even imagine how she'd react."
kayleigh.png,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_6,"Anyway, you and Meredith get on well. I can totally see you two together."
,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_7,"And you might find it odd, but..."
kayleigh_blushing.png,kayleigh_thinking_3,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_8,Well...
,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_9,I feel like...
kayleigh_happy.png,kayleigh_romantic,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_10,"I gotta say, it actually doesn't bother me at all?"
kayleigh_thinking,kayleigh_thinking_1,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_11_1,"Hmm... Truth be told, I don't see why your thing with her means that [wave amp=20 freq=10]we[/wave] can't keep having 'cute moments' together."
kayleigh.png,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_11_2,"So long as Meredith's fine with it, of course!"
,kayleigh_thinking_2,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_12,And who knows? Maybe she even...
kayleigh_happy.png,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_13,"Well, that's a topic for another time."
meredith_blushing.png,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_1,"After the night we spent together, I was a little nervous about where things would go, but... I'm honestly OK with this."
,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_2_1,"I must admit, I AM a little jealous. But... the weird part is, I don't know who I'm more jealous [wave amp=20 freq=10]of[/wave]?"
meredith_awkward.png,meredith_thinking_4,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_2_2,"You're... you, and [wave amp=20 freq=10]Kayleigh[/wave]..."
,meredith_awkward_2,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_3,"Is this coming out weird? Am I being weird? I'm being weird, aren't I?"
,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_4,"It's just, uh... Okay, let me swerve back a sec. Erase all that."
,meredith_laugh_1,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_5,[wave amp=20 freq=10]You two make a lovely couple.[/wave]
meredith_shocked.png,meredith_thinking_2,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_6_1,Huh.
meredith_shocked_open.png,meredith_surprise_3,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_6_2,Actually...
meredith_happy.png,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_7,"Y'know what, mate? To hell with it! Why not keep dating? New world, new rules, right!?"
meredith_thinking.png,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_8,"And, uh... if you and Kayleigh ever feel up for a bit of extra company when you two are [wave amp=20 freq=10]hanging out[/wave], feel free to invite me? She's... cool."
,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_9,"Ugh, nevermind. Scratch that last part."
meredith_awkward.png,,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_10,"Well, unless you two [wave amp=20 freq=10]also[/wave]..."
meredith_blushing.png,meredith_awkward,MOD_ONELIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_11,You know what? I'm going to stop talking now.
