With both the Archangels appearing and us fusing for the first time, things have suddenly gotten very strange in my life lately.
	Strange?
	In a bad way?
Don’t take that the wrong way! Fusing with you is cool. But it’s [wave amp=30 freq=10]weird[/wave], right?
I guess I wasn’t expecting this island to throw any more surprises at me. Not to mention your plan to find a way to [wave amp=30 freq=10]leave[/wave]...
It’s been so long since I arrived here, I’ve barely thought about going back.
I guess… [pause]I was never that close to anyone back home to begin with. I don’t like most people.
I think that’s why I like distracting myself. 
When I arrived here, I kind of got obsessed with electronics. Making lights and stuff for the town. 
It gives me something to focus on so I don’t have to think about everything else I’m missing.
I think it was the same with finding that album.
Urgh. [pause]Sorry for being such a… [pause]Sorry for being me, I guess.
	You don’t have to apologise!
	Hey, don’t worry about it!
Heh. [pause]Thanks. [pause]For a second, I sounded like Kayleigh there. 
Do you know what I mean? She always acts like she’s got something to apologise for.
That’s enough sincerity. 
C’mon, let’s finish up here.

The Gramophone café always reminds me of my dad. [pause]He’d brew a pot of coffee every morning before heading into London for work, [pause]so that coffee smell is kind of seared into my brain. 
	Sounds nostalgic!
	That’s a nice memory!
I guess so...
I can never tell if I miss my parents. [pause]We never had a huge amount in common. [pause]They grew up in a different time and a different place.
I guess there was a big generational divide. [pause]It’s not my fault my parents listened to [shake rate=30 level=10]incredibly[/shake] bad music!
When I moved out to go to college, we didn’t really stay… [pause]in touch. [pause]That’s OK. 
	That’s sad.
	That sounds kinda lonely.
I suppose it is.
Y’know, [pause]I don’t have many strong memories of growing up.
I had friends, and life experiences, but thinking back on those memories…
It always feels like something that was just happening around me, not something I was participating in.
Like I’ve never been fully in the pilot seat.
I guess I was an uncool kid, then an uncool teenager. [pause]As for being an adult…
Well, there’s still time to see how I do at this.
Maybe I just need to make more friends whilst I’m here in New Wirral. [pause]Urgh.
No-one [wave amp=30 rate=10]ever[/wave] tells you growing up that making friends as an adult is hard.
	At least we're friends!
	What about us?
It’s easier with us – we have, [pause]like, [pause]a hobby together.
	A... hobby?
	We do?
Yeah, [pause]we’re looking for a magic world portal. [pause]That’s a hobby, right?
	I guess so!
I mean, I hope we'd still hang out... even if we didn't find your doorway
	Of course we would!
		Heh. Cool.
	You’re cute when you blush!
		Urgh, you [wave amp=30 freq=10]can’t[/wave] compliment me like that. [pause]I totally don’t handle it well.
		It makes my whole body feel like it’s folding in on itself.
Huh, [pause]I’m more tired than I thought.
Do you think transforming and battling counts as exercise? [pause]I guess it’s pretty exhausting.
Anyway, let's go and hang out together and punch monsters and stuff.

Y’know, all that stuff with the vinyl record I was looking for got me thinking.
	What about?
	Go on...
Well, let me put it this way:
We found an album that had never been recorded in my world, right?
And if there are infinite worlds, then this implies… [pause]Infinite albums.
	I guess that makes sense!
	Could that be true?
So like, [pause]when I was a teenager, I was a big fan of this old fantasy author. [pause]I was a huge dork.
Every book he wrote wasn’t just a story, it was like peering into his mind. [pause]His aspirations, his beliefs, his philosophies…
I guess writing a book is like putting a bit of yourself out into the world, forever.
Eventually I read everything he’d ever written when he was alive, and the finality of it stuck with me.
I’d experienced everything he’d ever written. There would [shake rate=30 level=10]never[/shake] be any more. 
I guess that happens to all of us when we die… [pause]Eventually, we’ll have said everything we’ll ever say.
But if there’s infinite worlds, then maybe there’s an endless list of different books he ended up writing.
And maybe… [pause]there’s endless versions of us, having endless memories and experiences of their own.
Maybe we never really die, [pause]in a sense.
Just something that’s been on my mind, is all.
C’mon, shall we go?

OK, are you ready for this?
...
Movie night. [pause]At my place. [pause]Are you in?
	Sure!
	Not now.
		Boo. Give me a shout when you’re up for it. It should be a laugh
Alright, you’re gonna love this.
So check this out – the only working movie projector on New Wirral.
	Amazing!
		How did you get this?!
It’s been one of my many side-hobbies.
It’s time I tell you about New Wirral’s unspoken curse.
You see this? 
It’s a video tape. [pause]But not just any video tape...
It’s a video tape for the 1981 action movie “Blood Puncher”.
Hundreds of video tapes have washed up on New Wirral’s shores in the time I’ve been here. 
I’ve collected them. 
All of them.
Guess what?
They’re Blood Puncher.
[shake rate=30 level=10]Every single tape is Blood Puncher.[/shake]
[shake rate=30 level=10]It’s the only film you can watch in New Wirral.[/shake]
	Sounds like my kind of movie!
	I'm ready to enjoy this ironically!
That’s the spirit.
I wanted to say, [pause]thanks for hanging out with me.
I’ve been pretty miserable on New Wirral, but this is, like, the most fun I’ve had.
	I'm glad we're friends!
	Maybe this should be a date?

PLATONIC
Heh. Me too, {player}.
OK, enough sincerity, mate.
We have an awful movie to watch. I hope you're ready.

ROMANTIC
[pause].[pause].[pause].
Took you long enough to ask.
C’mon, we’ve [wave amp=30 freq=30]literally[/wave] fused together. 
It kinda puts me in your head a bit, y'know? And, [pause]like, [pause]of course I think you're cute.
Why not? Date night. With a bad movie.
Can we keep things casual? [pause]Like, [pause]non-committal?
I’ve, [pause]uh, [pause]only ever been with guys before – [pause]so this is also kinda new to me.
I want to hang out with you still… 
But I also want to make out with you sometimes.
Anyway, [pause]I’ve seen this movie a million times.
So… we don’t have to do much watching.
