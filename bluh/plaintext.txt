# KAYLEIGH: Meredith relationship

*So...* You and Meredith, huh?

> It's OK! It's not like you promised me anything exclusive, Kylie. We just had a cute moment or two together. That's all.
> I get what you see in her, I think. All in all, she's dead-on.
> She's strong, and smart, and knows who she is and what she stands for, and doesn't try to hide or apologize for it.
> Easy on the eyes, too.
> But *maybe* we should keep that between us. If Meredith knew how I felt about her, I think she'd be too embarrassed to stand in the same room as me.
> Anyway, you and Meredith get on well. I can totally see you two together.
> And you might find it odd, but...
> Well...
> I feel like...
> I gotta say, it actually doesn't bother me at all?
# thinking3
> Hmm... Truth be told, I don't see why your thing with her means that *we* can't keep having cute moments together.  So long as Meredith's fine with it, of course!
> Does that sound OK to you?
# [choice (cribbed from early decision where Kayleigh asks if you're ready to turn into a monster again): Definitely! / Uh, I guess so!]
> Grand!

> After the night we spent together, I was a little nervous about where things would go, but... I'm honestly OK with this.
> I must admit, I *am* a little jealous. But... the weird part is, I don't know who I'm more jealous *of*?  You're... you, and *Kayleigh*...
# thinking4
> Is this coming out weird?  Am I being weird?  I'm being weird, aren't I?
> It's just, uh... Okay, let me swerve back a sec.  Erase all that.
# awkward2
> *You two make a lovely couple.*
> Actually...
# laugh1
> Y'know what, mate?  To hell with it!  Why not keep dating?  New world, new rules, right?
> And, uh... if you and Kayleigh ever feel up for a bit of extra company when you two are *hanging out*, feel free to invite me?  She's... cool.
