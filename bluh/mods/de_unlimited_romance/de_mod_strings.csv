MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_1, It's OK! It's not like you promised me anything exclusive, Kylie. We just had a cute moment or two together. That's all.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_2, I get what you see in her, I think. All in all, she's dead-on.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_3, She's strong, and smart, and knows who she is and what she stands for, and doesn't try to hide or apologize for it.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_4, Easy on the eyes, too.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_5, But [wave amp=20 freq=10]maybe[/wave] we should keep that between us. If Meredith knew how I felt about her, I think she'd be too embarrassed to stand in the same room as me.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_6, Anyway, you and Meredith get on well. I can totally see you two together.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_7, And you might find it odd, but...
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_8, Well...
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_9, I feel like...
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_10, I gotta say, it actually doesn't bother me at all?
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_11, Hmm... Truth be told, I don't see why your thing with her means that [wave amp=20 freq=10]we[/wave] can't keep having cute moments together. So long as Meredith's fine with it, of course!
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_12, Does that sound OK to you?
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGHMEREDITH_13, Grand!
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_1, After the night we spent together, I was a little nervous about where things would go, but... I'm honestly OK with this.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_2, I must admit, I [wave amp=20 freq=10]am[/wave] a little jealous. But... the weird part is, I don't know who I'm more jealous [wave amp=20 freq=10]of[/wave]? You're... you, and [wave amp=20 freq=10]Kayleigh[/wave]...
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_3, Is this coming out weird? Am I being weird? I'm being weird, aren't I?
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_4, It's just, uh... Okay, let me swerve back a sec. Erase all that.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_5, [wave amp=20 freq=10]You two make a lovely couple.[/wave]
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_6, Actually...
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_7, Y'know what, mate? To hell with it! Why not keep dating? New world, new rules, right!?
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_8, And, uh... if you and Kayleigh ever feel up for a bit of extra company when you two are [wave amp=20 freq=10]hanging out*, feel free to invite me? She's... cool.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_9, Ugh, nevermind. Scratch that last part.
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_10, Well, unless you two [wave amp=20 freq=10]also[/wave]...
MOD_DEUNLIMITED_ROMANCE_MEREDITHKAYLEIGH_11, You know what? I'm going to stop talking now.
