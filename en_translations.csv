SO EAGER IN YOUR NAIVETY.
"END_PART9_MORGANTE5_OPTION1",Are you here to mock me?
"END_PART9_MORGANTE6",IN THIS MOMENT, WE HAVE A SHARED GOAL.
"END_PART9_MORGANTE8_OPTION1",Understand what?
"END_PART9_MORGANTE9",YOU HUMANS CREATE US WITH YOUR DREAMS AND IDEALS.

THE POTENTIAL ENERGY OF MANKIND IS LIMITLESS.
"END_PART9_MORGANTE12",SO WAKE UP, ALREADY!
"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER14",The Amber Lodge is the real attraction.
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_1_1",DON’T MIND ME!
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_2_1",HMM. SOME HUMANS GOT IN HERE.
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_3_1",I REMEMBER YOU! 
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_3_2",AND I REALLY DON’T KNOW HOW YOU FOUND YOURSELVES DOWN HERE.
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_4_1",YOU AND I...
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_5_1",YOU DON’T QUIT, DO YOU?
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_6_1",ALEPH_DIALOGUE_6_1
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_7_1",YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD SHOW ME A BIT MORE RESPECT. 
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_8_1",WE GOTTA STOP MEETING LIKE THIS!
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_9_1",MY NEW RECRUITS REALLY ARE A ROWDY BUNCH.
"ALEPH_DIALOGUE_10_1",YES, IT’S ME AGAIN, HERE TO RECRUIT THIS TALENTED INDIVIDUAL YOU’RE FIGHTING.
"AA_ALICE_PRE_BATTLE_ALICE1",YOU IGNORED MY INSTRUCTIONS TO STAY PUT! DON’T YOU RESPECT ME? DON’T YOU REALISE JUST HOW IMPORTANT I AM?!
"AA_ALICE_PRE_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH2",You’ve got a pretty big ego, huh?
"AA_ALICE_PRE_BATTLE_MEREDITH2",No, you’re right. I totally don’t respect you.
"AA_ALICE_PRE_BATTLE_EUGENE2",Buddy, I have NO idea who you are.
"AA_ALICE_PRE_BATTLE_FELIX2",Are we supposed to know who you are…?
"AA_ALICE_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA2",My respect is not so wantonly given, spirit.
"DOG_NAME",Barkley
"AA_ALICE_PRE_BATTLE_DOG2",Grrrr…
"AA_ALICE_PRE_BATTLE_ALICE3",SUCH RUDENESS, TOWARDS A MEMBER OF ROYALTY NO LESS! IF YOU REFUSE TO USE YOUR HEADS, I’LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE THEM FROM YOUR SHOULDERS!
"AA_ALICE_POST_BATTLE_ALICE1",YOU REALLY HAVE NO RESPECT, DO YOU? HOW INFURIATING!
"AA_ALICE_POST_BATTLE_ALEPH2",MISS ALICE, PLEASURE TO MEET YOU! I NEED SOMEONE WITH YOUR… PEOPLE SKILLS.
"AA_ALICE_POST_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH3",I guess she saw herself as the queen of her own little world, huh?
"AA_ALICE_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH3",Do all Archangels think so highly of themselves, or was she just a [wave amp=30 freq=10]special[/wave] case?
"AA_ALICE_POST_BATTLE_EUGENE3",These Archangels are pretty rude, huh?
"AA_ALICE_POST_BATTLE_FELIX3",Do you think that Archangel really wanted our heads, or do you think it was a turn of phrase? Actually, don’t answer that. I don’t want to know.
"AA_ALICE_POST_BATTLE_VIOLA3",I will not bow to anyone who speaks so brazenly to me, royalty or otherwise.
"AA_CUBE_POST_BATTLE_CUBE1",ARE MY ANGLES IMPERFECT ALSO? THE CALCULATIONS WERE CORRECT... I HAVE FAILED IN 3 SIMULTANEOUS DIMENSIONS.
"AA_CUBE_POST_BATTLE_ALEPH2",WHAT GOOD TIMING! I WAS JUST THINKING HOW I NEEDED TO RECRUIT SOMEONE WHO’S GOOD WITH NUMBERS. HOW’D YOU LIKE A JOB, MY NEW CUBOID FRIEND?
"AA_CUBE_POST_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH3",It turned out that wasn’t a friendly Archangel after all. Just our luck!
"AA_CUBE_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH3",AA_CUBE_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH3
"AA_CUBE_POST_BATTLE_EUGENE3",That Archangel was strange. It felt like no matter what angle I saw it from, it looked the same.
"AA_CUBE_POST_BATTLE_FELIX3",Next time we meet an Archangel, I’ll just assume it wants to kill us straight away.
"AA_CUBE_POST_BATTLE_VIOLA3",If there was method in that spirit’s madness, I did not see it.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_POST_BATTLE_ALEPH2",OH NEAT, A BIG SKELETON GUY! EVERY TEAM NEEDS ONE OF THOSE.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_POST_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH3",That was pretty creepy, huh? I wonder if what it said was true… [pause]Maybe people [wave amp=30 freq=10]do[/wave] spend their whole lives thinking about death.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH3",The number of nightmare creatures that want to kill us on this island is just… [pause]way too high.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_POST_BATTLE_EUGENE3",That was the biggest skeleton monster I’ve [wave amp=30 freq=10]ever[/wave] seen! Pretty creepy, huh?
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_POST_BATTLE_FELIX3",That was… unpleasant.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_POST_BATTLE_VIOLA3",Cowards die many times before their deaths, but the valiant never taste of death but once.
"AA_MAMMON_NAME",Mammon
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_MAMMON1",Thank you for arriving at our scheduled meeting. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated.
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE2",So you’re behind this, huh?
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE3",So tell me: Why would an Archangel try to take over the [shake rate=30 level=10]property market?![/shake] 
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_MAMMON4",My kin are born of humanity’s ego. The strongest desires of your kind give us form.

I exist as tribute to mankind’s consumption.

I want order because you do. I crave structure because you do.
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE5",...
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_MAMMON6",I want what you want, Human Eugene. I can read your heart. 
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE7",You don’t know a SINGLE thing about me.
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_MAMMON8",I sympathise with the Human Eugene.

The Human Eugene finds no value in themselves outside of their cause.
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE10",I...
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE11_OPTION1",Don’t listen to it, Eugene!
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE12",[shake rate=30 level=10]STOP![/shake] 
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE18",[shake rate=30 level=10]It’s the same [pause]old [pause]story![/shake]
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE19",{player}...
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE20",Wanna burn down this pile of junk?
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_EUGENE20_OPTION1",You know I do.
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_POST_BATTLE_ALEPH1",HO HO, QUITE THE OPERATION YOU HAVE HERE, MR. MAMMON!
"EUGENE_QUEST5_PART2_POST_BATTLE_EUGENE4",This place is falling apart. C’mon, we gotta go!
"AA_PUPPET_POST_BATTLE_ALEPH2",NICE TO MEET YOU, MY HATTED FRIEND! SAY, ARE YOU LOOKING FOR A NEW LINE OF WORK? LET’S TALK!
"AA_PUPPET_POST_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH3",The way that Archangel spoke about us, it was like we weren’t even real… like we were just toys. [pause]Maybe it’ll think differently now that we beat it.
"AA_PUPPET_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH3",That Archangel better have learned that I am [wave amp=30 freq=10]no-one’s[/wave] plaything.
"AA_PUPPET_POST_BATTLE_EUGENE3",There’s [wave amp=30 freq=10]always[/wave] some monster who thinks that people’s lives are their playthings. [pause]Archangel or man, they’re dangerous all the same.
"AA_PUPPET_POST_BATTLE_FELIX3",Did he make… [pause]dolls of us? I don’t think I’ll sleep easy after that fight, that’s for sure.
"AA_PUPPET_POST_BATTLE_VIOLA3",That spirit saw us as mere toys. Let that be a lesson to us that their kind and ours are not alike, even in the slightest.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA1",...I was expecting more.
"AA_ROBIN_NAME",Robin Goodfellow
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN2",I MUST ASK FOR QUIET, PLEASE.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA4",What “show”? Who [wave amp=30 freq=10]are[/wave] you?
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN5",WHY, I AM BUT A MERRY WANDERER OF THE NIGHT…

THEY CALL ME HOBGOBLIN, AND PUCK...
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN6",I AM ROBIN GOODFELLOW!
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN7",AND YOU AND I, VIOLA OF MESSALINE, SHARE MUCH HISTORY.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN8",I DISCOVERED THIS BOOK AMONG THE REMAINS OF THE SHIP.

A CURIOUS READ.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN9",LET ME SEE…

PAGE 645 – “TWELFTH NIGHT”.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA11",I do not understand...
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN12",AH YES, HERE I AM:

PAGE 365 – “A MIDSUMMER NIGHT’S DREAM”.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN14",MY DEAR VIOLA… YOU AND I?

WE ARE MERELY INVENTIONS OF A MORTAL PLAYWRIGHT – A MR. WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE, IN PARTICULAR.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA17",[pause].[pause].[pause].
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA18",Does this “Robin Goodfellow” speak the truth, [pause]{player}?
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA19_OPTION1",It’s true.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA20",Thank you.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN21",YOU KNOW I SPEAK THE TRUTH.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA23",I believe…
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA24",I believe your “truth” changes nothing.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA28",[shake rate=30 level=10]I defy them![/shake] 
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PRE_BATTLE_ROBIN29",HA HA HA!

HOW UNEXPECTED!
"VIOLA_QUEST4_POST_BATTLE_ALEPH1",YOU SEEM TO BE IN A BIT OF A BIND, DON’T YOU MR. GOODFELLOW?
"VIOLA_QUEST4_POST_BATTLE_VIOLA3",We would be wise to return to our place of safety…
"AA_TOWER_POST_BATTLE_ALEPH2",HEY, BUDDY! LOOKS LIKE YOU’RE LOSING A FIGHT HERE. WHY DON’T YOU COME WITH ME?
"AA_TOWER_POST_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH3",I think we gave that Archangel a “reality check”, wouldn’t you say?
"AA_TOWER_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH3",I guess even the most [wave amp=30 freq=10]annoying[/wave] Archangel will shut up if you punch it enough times. We should take that lesson to heart.
"AA_TOWER_POST_BATTLE_EUGENE3",Archangels may be powerful, but that doesn’t mean that they’re smart.
"AA_TOWER_POST_BATTLE_FELIX3",That Archangel was a pretty big fan of talking nonsense, huh? At least we got it to shut up.
"AA_TOWER_POST_BATTLE_VIOLA3",That spirit had little sense left in its words. Perhaps its defeat at our hands shall humble it.
"AA_CUBE_PRE_BATTLE_CUBE1",3RD DIMENSIONAL SPACE IS IMPERFECT. SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS REMAIN TRUE. ALL THINGS HAVE 4 SIDES.
"AA_CUBE_PRE_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH2",This Archangel seems a bit eccentric, but maybe it’s a friendly one!
"AA_CUBE_PRE_BATTLE_MEREDITH2",I’d say this thing hasn’t got its head screwed on right, [pause]but it seems to lack a head altogether.
"AA_CUBE_PRE_BATTLE_EUGENE2",This thing is kind of hard to look at...
"AA_CUBE_PRE_BATTLE_FELIX2",Perhaps this one won’t try to attack us. What do you think?
"AA_CUBE_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA2",Is this spirit a philosopher of sorts? Or is it simply in the grips of madness?
"AA_CUBE_PRE_BATTLE_DOG2",Arf?
"AA_CUBE_PRE_BATTLE_CUBE3",NO. I SEE INCONSISTENCY WITHIN YOU. YOU ARE IMPERFECT BEINGS. LET ME RIGHT ALL YOUR WRONG ANGLES!
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_POST_BATTLE_LM1",NOT EVEN OUR KIND CAN ESCAPE TRUE DEATH...
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_PRE_BATTLE_AA1",YOU MEAT THINGS DREAM OF DEATH SO MUCH. YOU SPEND YOUR ENTIRE SHORT LIVES DREAMING OF IT. IS THAT WHAT BRINGS YOU TO ME?
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_PRE_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH2",Are you asking… if we came here to die? [pause]I don’t think we did, to be honest with you.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_PRE_BATTLE_MEREDITH2",This guy looks pretty metal. [pause]I get the impression he might want to kill us, though.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_PRE_BATTLE_EUGENE2",Nah, we came here to fight.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_PRE_BATTLE_FELIX2",I feel like this doesn’t bode well for us.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA2",I fear death not – [pause]a brave death outweighs a coward’s life!
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_PRE_BATTLE_DOG2",Grrrr...
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_PRE_BATTLE_AA3",LET ME FEAST ON YOUR FEAR, AS I SHOW YOU A TRUE DEATH.

"KAYLEIGH_ARCHANGEL_REACTION1_1",It’s an [shake rate=30 level=10]Archangel[/shake]…
"KAYLEIGH_ARCHANGEL_REACTION2",Another Archangel… It’s as [shake rate=30 level=10]painful[/shake] to look at as the others…
"KAYLEIGH_ARCHANGEL_REACTION3",An [shake rate=30 level=10]Archangel[/shake]! Be on you guard, {player}!
"MEREDITH_ARCHANGEL_REACTION1_1",[shake rate=30 level=10]Wh-what is that?![/shake] [pause]Why does it look so… [shake rate=30 level=10]wrong?![/shake]
"MEREDITH_ARCHANGEL_REACTION2_1",I-it’s another Archangel…
"MEREDITH_ARCHANGEL_REACTION3",Oh. [pause]An Archangel. [pause]We’re in [wave amp=30 freq=10]trouble[/wave] again, aren’t we?
"EUGENE_ARCHANGEL_REACTION1_1",What – [pause]how – [pause]does that [wave amp=30 freq=10]thing[/wave] look like… [wave amp=30 freq=10]that[/wave]?! [pause]It’s breaking my brain…
"EUGENE_ARCHANGEL_REACTION2",It’s an Archangel again! [pause]Urgh, [pause]just looking at it makes me feel like it’s [wave amp=30 freq=10]not supposed to be here[/wave]…
"EUGENE_ARCHANGEL_REACTION3",[shake rate=30 level=10]An Archangel![/shake] [pause]Get ready, {player}!
"FELIX_ARCHANGEL_REACTION1_1",I-I’ve never seen anything like this… [pause]what’s going on, {player}...? [pause]Why does it look like [shake rate=30 level=10]that[/shake]?!
"FELIX_ARCHANGEL_REACTION2_1",Another Archangel! Just looking at it takes some courage. My whole body is [shake rate=30 level=10]screaming[/shake] at me to turn away.
"FELIX_ARCHANGEL_REACTION3",I’m [wave amp=30 freq=10]never[/wave] gonna get used to the feeling of seeing an Archangel…
"VIOLA_ARCHANGEL_REACTION1_1",[shake rate=30 level=10]This spirit![/shake] I have not seen another like it… [pause]It is as if it is not [shake rate=30 level=10]meant[/shake] for our world.
"VIOLA_ARCHANGEL_REACTION2",Another spirit which defies all rational thought! I can [shake rate=30 level=10]barely[/shake] keep my gaze upon it…
"VIOLA_ARCHANGEL_REACTION3",{player} – it is another one of those [shake rate=30 level=10]fell spirits[/shake]! The ones you call “Archangel”.
"POSTGAME_MORGANTE_PRE_BATTLE1",AH, {player.to_upper} AND {partner.to_upper}.

HOW FORTUNATE YOU SHOULD APPEAR JUST AS I HAVE NEED OF A SACRIFICE.

TRULY THE MER-LINE SMILES ON US TODAY.
"POSTGAME_MORGANTE_POST_BATTLE",A SACRIFICE IS A SACRIFICE. THE RITUAL IS COMPLETE.

ARCHANGELS HAVE RETURNED TO NEW WIRRAL.
"AA_PUPPET_POST_BATTLE_PUPPET1",MY DOLLS! YOU HAVE KILLED MY DOLLS!
"AA_PUPPET_PRE_BATTLE_AA1",ARE YOU MORE TOYS FOR MY COLLECTION? I DESIRE MORE PLAYTHINGS...
"AA_PUPPET_PRE_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH2",This Archangel’s eyes are creeping me out...
"AA_PUPPET_PRE_BATTLE_MEREDITH2",Sorry, mate. We’re not here to play.
"AA_PUPPET_PRE_BATTLE_EUGENE2",Are people just toys to your kind, huh?!
"AA_PUPPET_PRE_BATTLE_FELIX2",I don’t know if this guy has our best interests at heart.
"AA_PUPPET_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA2",I sense no kindness in this spirit’s words.
"AA_PUPPET_PRE_BATTLE_DOG2",Grrrr...
"AA_PUPPET_PRE_BATTLE_AA3",YES… YOU TWO WILL MAKE A FINE PAIR OF GLOVE PUPPETS! HAHAHAHA
"KAYLEIGH_STATION_REACTION1",Is this… [pause]a train station? It should be OK to take a look around, right?
"KAYLEIGH_STATION_REACTION2",Another one of these old train stations… I haven’t forgotten about the [wave amp=30 freq=10]first time[/wave] we uncovered one of these.
"KAYLEIGH_STATION_REACTION3",I’m getting pretty used to these dusty old train stations. The silence is still pretty creepy, though.
"MEREDITH_STATION_REACTION1",Uh, [pause]does this island have an underground railway network? I’m guessing that this has been here for a [wave amp=30 freq=10]while[/wave]…
"MEREDITH_STATION_REACTION2",Another underground train station, huh? I wonder who built these?
"MEREDITH_STATION_REACTION3A",There’s something weird about these underground stations. They [wave amp=30 freq=10]almost[/wave] look like they were man-made, but they don’t quite [wave amp=30 freq=10]feel[/wave] right. 
"EUGENE_STATION_REACTION1",What?! [pause]Is this a [shake rate=30 level=10]train station[/shake]?! No-one ever said something like THIS was on New Wirral!
"EUGENE_STATION_REACTION2",Another train station, huh? This island sure holds some secrets…
"EUGENE_STATION_REACTION3",Man, we might be some of the first people to step foot in here for a LONG time…
"FELIX_STATION_REACTION1",Wait, is this a train station?! No-one in town ever mentioned this… do the people here not know about this?
"FELIX_STATION_REACTION2",These train stations give me the creeps. I feel like we’re not meant to be here…
"FELIX_STATION_REACTION3",Yet another ancient train station. Something must have happened to cause these to emerge recently, right?
"VIOLA_STATION_REACTION1",This place feels unwelcoming… more so than the rest of this strange land.
"VIOLA_STATION_REACTION2",The air here sits heavy in my lungs. This place has been in slumber for an age, I can feel it.
"VIOLA_STATION_REACTION3",Another one of these old and curious places. I would not like to be here longer than is necessary, {player}.
"KAYLEIGH_PLATFORM_REACTION1_1",The pressure here is [shake rate=30 level=10]overwhelming[/shake]… it felt like this when Morgante first appeared…
"KAYLEIGH_PLATFORM_REACTION1_2",It’s like there’s a [shake rate=30 level=10]really[/shake] loud noise in the air, but I can’t hear it…
"KAYLEIGH_PLATFORM_REACTION2_1",That feeling again. Like radio static in my brain…
"KAYLEIGH_PLATFORM_REACTION2_2",The air tastes like metal… It hurts my head just being here…
"KAYLEIGH_PLATFORM_REACTION3_1",It’s that atmosphere again…
"KAYLEIGH_PLATFORM_REACTION3_2",I’m getting used to it now, but it still makes my head hurt…
"MEREDITH_PLATFORM_REACTION1_1",What’s WRONG with this place? [pause]It feels like there’s something [wave amp=30 freq=10]pushing[/wave] against me…
"MEREDITH_PLATFORM_REACTION1_2",It’s like there’s television static in my brain…
"MEREDITH_PLATFORM_REACTION2_1",There’s that [wave amp=30 freq=10]weird[/wave] feeling again... It still sucks.
"MEREDITH_PLATFORM_REACTION2_2",MEREDITH_PLATFORM_REACTION2_2
"MEREDITH_PLATFORM_REACTION3_1",I think I’m slowly getting used to the feeling of being on these station platforms.
"MEREDITH_PLATFORM_REACTION3_2",The key is to ignore that your head feels like it’s gonna [wave amp=30 freq=10]explode[/wave].
"EUGENE_PLATFORM_REACTION1_1",Do you feel that, {player}? It’s like radio static that I can’t [wave amp=30 freq=10]hear[/wave], [pause]but I can [wave amp=30 freq=10]feel[/wave]...
"EUGENE_PLATFORM_REACTION1_2",It’s messed up…
"EUGENE_PLATFORM_REACTION2_1",It’s that weird atmosphere again… Can you feel it?
"EUGENE_PLATFORM_REACTION2_2",It makes my teeth itch…
"EUGENE_PLATFORM_REACTION3_1",Oh, that [wave amp=30 freq=10]painful atmosphere[/wave] is back. That never means anything good.
"EUGENE_PLATFORM_REACTION3_2",Stay on your guard, buddy.
"FELIX_PLATFORM_REACTION1_1",Oh man, what’s that noise? [pause]I don’t mean, like, a noise you can hear. [pause]It’s like there’s something wrong with the air…
"FELIX_PLATFORM_REACTION1_2",This place feels [wave amp=30 freq=10]really[/wave] bad to be in…
"FELIX_PLATFORM_REACTION2_1",There’s that [wave amp=30 freq=10]presence[/wave] again. It makes the hairs on the back of my arms stand up.
"FELIX_PLATFORM_REACTION2_2",It’s really hard to [wave amp=30 freq=10]think[/wave] here. [pause]Do you get that?
"FELIX_PLATFORM_REACTION3_1",Once again, it’s that [wave amp=30 freq=10]really bad feeling[/wave] in the air. I’m kind of used to it at this point, at least.
"FELIX_PLATFORM_REACTION3_2",…Nah, I’ve changed my mind. I don’t think I’ll [wave amp=30 freq=10]ever[/wave] get used to this.
"VIOLA_PLATFORM_REACTION1_1",VIOLA_PLATFORM_REACTION1_1
"VIOLA_PLATFORM_REACTION1_2",Can you not feel it so? A sense of wrongness that lingers in the air, making it hard to breathe.
"VIOLA_PLATFORM_REACTION2_1",That accursed feeling is here again, {player}. It leaves a well of dread within me.
"VIOLA_PLATFORM_REACTION2_2",To step further feels like wading through an ocean…
"VIOLA_PLATFORM_REACTION3_1",I am slowly becoming accustomed to this hostile feeling in this place. After all, have we not braved it several times before now?
"VIOLA_PLATFORM_REACTION3_2",Yes, we must press on. It would take more than this unpleasant aura to stop me.
"AA_TOWER_POST_BATTLE_TOWER1",THERE IS ONE TRUTH NOW CLEAR TO ME… I HAVE BEEN BESTED… 
"AA_TOWER_PRE_BATTLE_AA1",TRUTH… LIES… YOUR FLEDGLING KIND CARE SO MUCH ABOUT SUCH TRIVIAL CONCEPTS. REALITY IS NOT TRUE! EMBRACE IGNORANCE!
"AA_TOWER_PRE_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH2",This thing certainly needs a reality check.
"AA_TOWER_PRE_BATTLE_MEREDITH2",This thing certainly has a questionable grip on “reality”.
"AA_TOWER_PRE_BATTLE_EUGENE2",...I don’t get it. What are you trying to say?
"AA_TOWER_PRE_BATTLE_FELIX2",As much as I’d love to “embrace ignorance”, I’ve got stuff to do.
"AA_TOWER_PRE_BATTLE_VIOLA2",Folly and ignorance are the common curses of mankind. Both are [wave amp=30 freq=10]already[/wave] plentiful, spirit.
"AA_TOWER_PRE_BATTLE_DOG2",Grrrr...
"AA_TOWER_PRE_BATTLE_AA3",YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND. LET ME AWAKEN YOU FROM YOUR FALSE PERCEPTIONS OF TRUTH AND LIES!
"RESTING_DOG_1",You and Barkley take a long nap together.
"RESTING_DOG_2",You and Barkley lazily roll a ball back and forth.
"RESTING_DOG_3",Barkley’s been a really good boy today, so you make sure he gets all the treats and belly rubs.
"RESTING_DOG_4",Barkley shares one of his treats with you. You try it, but it’s not very tasty.
"RESTING_DOG_5",Barkley licks your face!
"RESTING_DOG_6",RESTING_DOG_6
"RESTING_DOG_7",You try to play fetch with Barkley, but he’s more interested in the scents of nearby monsters.
"RESTING_DOG_8",Barkley finds a good digging spot! The two of you get absolutely covered in mud.
"RESTING_DOG_9",Barkley brings you a stick he’s really proud of!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_EUGENE1",Heh, [pause]c’mon. [pause]Between the two of us, you’re the one with the grand aspirations.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_EUGENE3",I’m looking forward to going back to my real home. [pause]I think I’ve become my best, badass self here.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_EUGENE1",Well I guess it was time New Wirral had a new date spot.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_EUGENE1_OPTION1",I’d say your project was a success!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_EUGENE2",[shake rate=30 level=10]Uh, [pause][pause]I, [pause][pause]I guess so…[/shake]
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_EUGENE3_OPTION1",Not so confident with romance, huh?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_EUGENE4",I [pause]guess you’re right.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_EUGENE6",EUGENE_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_EUGENE6
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_EUGENE7",Yeah, [pause]I guess this is a date.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_FELIX1",Heh, [pause]no worries!
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_FELIX2",FELIX_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_FELIX2
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_FELIX1",I try my best. How did I do?
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_FELIX1_OPTION1",Asking me out on a date would have been easier.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_FELIX2",I mean, the zote story wasn’t a ploy just to get you to spend time with me.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_FELIX3",I [wave amp=30 freq=10]am[/wave] actually going to write more of it.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_FELIX4_OPTION1",That’s pretty cute of you.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_FELIX5",Like I said, I try my best.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_PLATONIC_KAYLEIGH1",Aw, don’t go making me blush now!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_PLATONIC_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1",I hope you keep playing.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_PLATONIC_KAYLEIGH2",So do I! Maybe we should write a song together, whilst out on our travels? 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_PLATONIC_KAYLEIGH3_OPTION1",I’m game!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_PLATONIC_KAYLEIGH4",Then it’s settled! Let’s do it!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_ROMANTIC_KAYLEIGH1",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_ROMANTIC_KAYLEIGH1
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_ROMANTIC_KAYLEIGH2_OPTION1",Joking aside, I do hope you continue to play!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_ROMANTIC_KAYLEIGH3",I…
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_VIOLA1",This, [pause]I cannot deny.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_VIOLA3",VIOLA_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_VIOLA3
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_VIOLA1",VIOLA_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_VIOLA1
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_VIOLA2_OPTION1",I see you as a good friend.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_VIOLA3",I…
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_VIOLA5",I wear my heart upon my sleeve. [pause]I cannot deny my feelings.
"EUGENE_CONVO1_EUGENE1",Y’know, [pause]taking on the Landkeepers like we did…
"EUGENE_CONVO10_EUGENE1",EUGENE_CONVO10_EUGENE1
"EUGENE_CONVO10_EUGENE3",EUGENE_CONVO10_EUGENE3
"EUGENE_CONVO10_EUGENE4",I’m normally kinda hopeless with relationships. [pause]Fighting Archangels is easier than trying to work out what someone else is feeling.
"EUGENE_CONVO11_EUGENE1",Do you ever think about… [pause]not going back to your world, {player}?
"EUGENE_CONVO11_EUGENE1_OPTION1",Why would I?
"EUGENE_CONVO11_EUGENE2",It’s like this: [pause]we’re not from the same point in our world’s history, are we?
"EUGENE_CONVO11_EUGENE4_OPTION1",What are you saying?
"EUGENE_CONVO11_EUGENE5",I told you about how the people of my world built a new and better world, right?
"EUGENE_CONVO12_EUGENE1",Do you really think that giant gateway can really take us home?
"EUGENE_CONVO12_EUGENE2_OPTION1",I believe so!
"EUGENE_CONVO12_EUGENE3",Momentous.
"EUGENE_CONVO13_EUGENE1",Man, [pause]if that big gateway does actually let people leave New Wirral, that’s gonna change a [wave amp=30 freq=10]lot[/wave] here.
"EUGENE_CONVO14_EUGENE1",Um, [pause]I think we should talk about what happened.
"EUGENE_CONVO14_EUGENE1_OPTION1",Talk about what?
"EUGENE_CONVO14_EUGENE2",When we, [pause]y’know…
"EUGENE_CONVO14_EUGENE3",When we all fused into a giant [shake rate=30 level=10]god monster[/shake] together and [shake rate=30 level=10]kicked Aleph’s ass![/shake]
"EUGENE_CONVO14_EUGENE5",I’m gonna be pretty honest with you, there’s a whole lot of “Archangel” business on the island that I’m not keeping up with at all. 
"EUGENE_CONVO14_EUGENE7",But what I do know is that we banded together and took down a big bad guy. [pause]That’s something I can wrap my brain around.
"EUGENE_CONVO15_EUGENE1",I hope your plan to find a way off this island works, buddy.
"PASSIVE_OVERWORLD_NEW_LONDON_EUGENE",This place gives me the creeps…
"EUGENE_CONVO16_EUGENE1",Man, that ruined town we passed through really creeped me out.
"EUGENE_CONVO16_EUGENE4",Maybe in time, the people of Harbourtown could go back and build it all back up again.
"EUGENE_CONVO17_EUGENE1",Gathering around a campfire in the wilderness, knowing all the while that [wave amp=30 freq=10]giant beasts[/wave] might attack us at any moment… [pause]I think you’re thinking the same thing I am right now, {player}.
"EUGENE_CONVO17_EUGENE1_OPTION1",Am I?
"EUGENE_CONVO17_EUGENE2",You’re thinking: [pause]“this is just what life was like for my caveman ancestors!”
"EUGENE_CONVO17_EUGENE2_OPTION1",What?
"EUGENE_CONVO17_EUGENE3",I’m totally right. You were thinking it too, buddy.
"EUGENE_CONVO18_EUGENE1",I need to work on my battle shouts.
"EUGENE_CONVO18_EUGENE1_OPTION1",Your what?
"EUGENE_CONVO18_EUGENE2",Yeah! [pause]Like when I’m facing down some foes, and just before I transform I yell something like, “let’s do this!” or “transform!”
"EUGENE_CONVO18_EUGENE2_OPTION1",You can do better than those!
"EUGENE_CONVO18_EUGENE3",It’s an ongoing project, OK? 
"EUGENE_CONVO18_EUGENE4",...
"EUGENE_CONVO18_EUGENE5_OPTION1",Not at all.
"EUGENE_CONVO18_EUGENE6",I’ll come back to this another time, then.
"EUGENE_CONVO19_EUGENE1",Sorry, [pause]I’m still getting used to the fact that we’re technically a couple now.
"EUGENE_CONVO19_EUGENE1_OPTION1",”Technically”?
"EUGENE_CONVO19_EUGENE2",Oh, I didn’t mean that in a [shake rate=30 level=10]bad[/shake] way!
"EUGENE_CONVO19_EUGENE3",I just wasn’t expecting something like [wave amp=30 freq=10]this[/wave] to happen to me here on New Wirral. Of course I’m [wave amp=30 freq=10]pumped[/wave] that we’re together!
"EUGENE_CONVO2_EUGENE1",I need to get back to my workout routine soon. [pause]I can’t save the world if I’m not at the top of my game, y’know!
"EUGENE_CONVO20_EUGENE1",It would be so easy to stay here together, wouldn’t it?
"EUGENE_CONVO20_EUGENE1_OPTION1",What do you mean?
"EUGENE_CONVO20_EUGENE2",You and I, living life in the quiet but [wave amp=30 freq=10]idyllic[/wave] Harbourtown. Nothing changing.
"EUGENE_CONVO20_EUGENE3",But… I just don’t think that’s us, is it? [pause]I think we’re both meant for more.
"EUGENE_CONVO3_EUGENE1",At first I was kind of weirded out by how, [pause]uh, [pause]retro the clothes of New Wirral are.
"EUGENE_CONVO4_EUGENE1",EUGENE_CONVO4_EUGENE1
"EUGENE_CONVO5_EUGENE1",How are you finding your {first_tape_name} form?
"EUGENE_CONVO6_EUGENE1",This is in, [pause]like, [pause]the top ten campfires I’ve ever helped make.
"EUGENE_CONVO7_EUGENE1",EUGENE_CONVO7_EUGENE1
"EUGENE_CONVO8_EUGENE1",People in the past really had to carry round these plastic cassettes just to listen to music, [pause]huh.
"EUGENE_CONVO8_EUGENE4",Hey, [pause]why are you giving me that look?! [pause]Am I wrong, or something?!
"EUGENE_CONVO9_EUGENE1",I hope we can bring this cassette technology back with us if we leave this island.
"EUGENE_CONVO9_EUGENE4",I’m pumped just talking about it!
"RESTING_EUGENE_DATING_1",Eugene tells you about the kind of place he’d like to live one day.
"RESTING_EUGENE_DATING_2",Eugene and you casually discuss your romantic history.
"RESTING_EUGENE_DATING_3",Eugene brags about his prowess at cooking romantic dinners.
"RESTING_EUGENE_DATING_4",Eugene shares a funny anecdote with you. He has many.
"RESTING_EUGENE_DATING_5",Eugene asks you about your hopes and dreams, and listens diligently.
"RESTING_EUGENE_PLATONIC_1",Eugene chats to you about his favourite workout routines.
"RESTING_EUGENE_PLATONIC_2",Eugene and you discuss new potential battle strategies.
"RESTING_EUGENE_PLATONIC_3",Eugene excitedly tells you about goings on in Harbourtown.
"RESTING_EUGENE_PLATONIC_4",The two of you trade battle tips as time passes uneventfully.
"RESTING_EUGENE_PLATONIC_5",Eugene discusses with you the differences between your two worlds.
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE1",EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE1
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE1_OPTION1",[color=#f382c5]I want us to be together.[/color]
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE2",I… [pause][pause]Uh...
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE3",I know. [pause]I mean, I do too. [pause]I’m just nervous.
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE5",Together we’re greater than the sum of our parts. [pause]It’s like when we fuse!
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE6",That said… [pause]we might have to break up if we find our way off the island.
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE8",But while we’re together, let’s have fun!
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE10",The same as always – [pause]Harbourtown’s unstoppable power couple!
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE11",Though maybe we can pause the adventuring, [pause]at least for tonight...
"EUGENE_ROMANCE_EUGENE_NO",Gotcha.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE1",Man, I gotta say…
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE2_OPTION1",You think?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE3",Yeah! [pause]It’s like… 
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE4",A real manifestation of our inner strength.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE6_OPTION1",I know what you mean!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE7A",Man, I knew you’d get it!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE7B",Man, I’m trying to be earnest here!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE8",I think I spent too long living without giving back, y’know?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE9_OPTION1",What’s the deal with your world?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE10",Eh, don’t worry about it. We can talk about it another time.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE11",I’ll go back. [pause]To my world, I mean. [pause]Once you find your doorway outta here, of course.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE12",I’ll bring my cassette tapes with me, [pause]and I’ll stand up for the people who need it the most.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE12_OPTION1",Like a monster-shaped superhero?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL1_EUGENE13",Like a monster-shaped superhero, yeah.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE1",I was thinking about how Clémence totally just... [pause]decided to run a café just because it helped make the town better.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE2_OPTION1",You don’t need to think about helping people all the time.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE3",Heh. [pause]If you say so.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE4",Maybe it’s just a compulsion that comes from my world.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE4_OPTION1",What do you mean?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE5",OK, [pause]on “my earth”, [pause]around halfway through the 21st century, there was a kind of… [pause]an upheaval. 
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE9",Being able to help the people in your community slowly became more important than being rich and famous, [pause]but I was never… [pause]very good at it.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE10_OPTION1",You don’t need to be a hero to have value!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE11",I know, [pause]but…
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE12",I think I need that for myself.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL2_EUGENE13",Anyway, [pause]enough from me. 
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE1",OK, [pause]I’ve decided.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE1_OPTION1",...Decided?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE2",I have a project in mind.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE4_OPTION1",You already stopped the Landkeepers!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE5",I don’t know… [pause]Stopping something [wave amp=30 freq=10]bad[/wave] doesn’t feel the same as doing something [wave amp=30 freq=10]good[/wave], [pause]right?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE6",Alright, I’m pumped! [pause]It’s gonna be awesome, [pause]just you wait.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE6_OPTION1",What are you planning?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE7",EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE7
"EUGENE_SOCIAL3_EUGENE8",The “defender of Harbourtown” should be able to keep a secret, [pause]after all.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE1",Hey, [pause]can I show you something? 
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE3_OPTION1",Sure!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE4",Alright! [pause]I’ll lead the way.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE5",Remember this place, [pause]{player}?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE6",This is where we went on our first [wave amp=30 freq=10]team-up mission[/wave] together!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE7",I realised that this ugly old building has been sitting here vacant since we cleared out the Landkeepers, [pause]so I thought I could put it to good use!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE8",C’mon, [pause]let me show you inside!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE9",With the ceiling window, [pause]this abandoned office actually gets a lot of natural light during the day.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE10_OPTION1",When did you do all this?!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE11",Hey, we don’t hang out [wave amp=30 freq=10]ALL[/wave] the time! [pause]I have my own free time away from our adventuring!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE12_OPTION1",This is incredible!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE13",Y-[pause]you actually think so?
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE15",I’m glad you like it.
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE15_OPTION1",You’re a pretty cool friend!
"EUGENE_SOCIAL4_EUGENE_NO",No worries, buddy. [pause]Another time.
"FELIX_CONVO1_FELIX1",You wanna hear something kinda weird?
"FELIX_CONVO10_FELIX1",I think I'm on a pretty good creative streak at the moment. I’m pretty happy about it!
"FELIX_CONVO10_FELIX1_OPTION1",You’re a pretty cheerful guy!
"FELIX_CONVO10_FELIX2",Huh… you really think so?
"FELIX_CONVO10_FELIX6",Besides, this island is too weird to take seriously. What’s the point in letting it get you down?
"FELIX_CONVO11_FELIX1",If that big gateway does actually lead us off New Wirral, maybe I need to start thinking about packing my stuff.
"FELIX_CONVO11_FELIX2",Can I take all my sketches back with me? Will they travel? I hope so!
"FELIX_CONVO12_FELIX1",That big fight on top of the train was pretty rad, huh?
"FELIX_CONVO12_FELIX2",I’m slowly trying to parse all the information we have around the “Archangels”.
"FELIX_CONVO12_FELIX7",It starts to make your head spin, doesn’t it?
"FELIX_CONVO12_FELIX7_OPTION1",I didn’t know you were such a detective!
"FELIX_CONVO12_FELIX8",It just seemed pretty important to keep track of all this stuff, I guess.
"FELIX_CONVO13_FELIX1",FELIX_CONVO13_FELIX1
"FELIX_CONVO13_FELIX2",You’re gonna have a lot of jobs to do, now. I hope you’re still gonna have free time to hang out!
"FELIX_CONVO13_FELIX2_OPTION1",Of course!
"FELIX_CONVO13_FELIX3",Heh. I hope so.
"FELIX_CONVO14_FELIX1",Oh, [pause]I heard about what happened with you, Kayleigh and those weird cultist guys.
"FELIX_CONVO14_FELIX1_OPTION1",You did?
"FELIX_CONVO14_FELIX2",They had some charismatic leader who wanted to gain an Archangel’s power, or something, right?
"FELIX_CONVO14_FELIX2_OPTION1",Something like that.
"FELIX_CONVO14_FELIX3",I hope they’re all OK. It can’t be easy to go through all that, [wave amp=30 freq=10]especially[/wave] on New Wirral.
"FELIX_CONVO15_FELIX1",Do you think the monsters round here are afraid of fire? I’ve noticed that they don’t seem to attack us whilst we’re camping out.
"FELIX_CONVO15_FELIX3",Maybe it’s just bad monster etiquette to attack humans when they’re resting!
"FELIX_CONVO16_FELIX1",One of the ranger captains was recently asking me about what life was like for me before I “landed here”.
"FELIX_CONVO17_FELIX1",Being out here with only a fire to warm us… it reminds me of summer camp!
"FELIX_CONVO17_FELIX2",…Or it would, if I ever went to summer camp. [pause]Which I didn’t.
"FELIX_CONVO17_FELIX3",But this is pretty close to how I [wave amp=30 freq=10]imagined[/wave] summer camp would be like as a kid… so I’m happy.
"FELIX_CONVO18_FELIX1",Hey, you should let me draw you sometime! Figure drawing is an important skill for artists to master.
"FELIX_CONVO18_FELIX3",Especially hands. I still struggle with drawing hands.
"FELIX_CONVO19_FELIX1",So let me get this straight…
"FELIX_CONVO19_FELIX2_OPTION1",Yeah!
"FELIX_CONVO19_FELIX3",But these “comic books” of yours don’t [wave amp=30 freq=10]animate[/wave] at all? They’re just printed on paper, and you just [wave amp=30 freq=10]look[/wave] at them?
"FELIX_CONVO19_FELIX4",That sounds pretty weird to me, but I’ll take your word for it!
"FELIX_CONVO2_FELIX1",Hey, have you ever eaten butter tarts?
"FELIX_CONVO20_FELIX1",Maybe I should start documenting more of the monsters on this island in my notebook.
"FELIX_CONVO3_FELIX1",I don’t know if you’ve noticed, [pause]but a lot of folks in New Wirral aren’t outsiders like you and me.
"FELIX_CONVO4_FELIX1",Being here on this island reminds me of being in my hometown.
"FELIX_CONVO5_FELIX1",I hope Kuneko is doing OK.
"FELIX_CONVO5_FELIX3",Wait! [pause]What if we’re [wave amp=30 freq=10]all[/wave] just created by someone else in the same way?
"FELIX_CONVO5_FELIX4",…[pause]No, I think I’m overthinking it.
"FELIX_CONVO6_FELIX1",Before I came here, [pause]I never would have guessed that my next relationship would involve so many campfires.
"FELIX_CONVO7_FELIX1",Maybe there are some good lessons to be learned from life in Harbourtown.
"FELIX_CONVO8_FELIX1",You know, [pause]being stranded on an island covered in monsters, away from my friends and family…
"FELIX_CONVO9_FELIX1",The new zote story I’m cooking up… [pause]I think I’ve really landed on something that works for it.
"FELIX_CONVO9_FELIX2_OPTION1",What do you mean?
"FELIX_CONVO9_FELIX3",Who knows! [pause]Maybe I’ll lose my touch. [pause]Maybe I’ll get trapped on another island. [pause]Maybe the world will end.
"RESTING_FELIX_DATING_1",Felix shows you some drawings he’s recently done.
"RESTING_FELIX_DATING_2",Felix eagerly tells you about some new story ideas he had recently.
"RESTING_FELIX_DATING_3",Felix politely listens to your thoughts.
"RESTING_FELIX_DATING_4",Felix chats with you about your favourite food.
"RESTING_FELIX_DATING_5",The two of you bond over some shared experiences.
"RESTING_FELIX_PLATONIC_1",Felix quietly and intently sketches as the time passes.
"RESTING_FELIX_PLATONIC_2",Felix muses about food he’s unable to acquire in New Wirral.
"RESTING_FELIX_PLATONIC_3",Felix recollects some fun anecdotes about citizens of Harbourtown.
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX1",FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX1
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX1_OPTION1",[color=#f382c5]I want us to be together.[/color]
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX2",I…
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX6",Oh, right. 
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX8",It’s “yes”, [pause]obviously. 
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX9",FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX9
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX10",I’d have to be a damn fool to say no.
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX11",There’s a high chance that if we do find a way back, [pause]we don’t actually come from the same world.
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX14",I want to share this story with you. [pause]For as long as it lasts.
"FELIX_ROMANCE_FELIX_NO",My bad. I should appreciate when someone is just having time to themselves.
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX1",So, something I said after we said goodbye to Kuneko…
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX2_OPTION1",I do!
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX3",I was kind of in a creative rut before I was, like, dropped here.
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX8",They also made damn sure not to pay me what I was worth, either.
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX9_OPTION1",Good for you!
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX10",Heh, thanks. I appreciate it.
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX11",All the bitterness from my previous work made it hard to get into the mindset I needed to create art again.
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX13",Thanks for hearing me out, {player}.
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX14_OPTION1",That’s right, we have indeed done that!
"FELIX_SOCIAL1_FELIX15",Heh.
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX1",Do you think that different worlds can have different… [pause]logics?
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX1_OPTION1",What do you mean?
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX2",Like, OK. The cassette tapes that record monsters… How do you think that works, exactly?
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX2_OPTION1",The cassette players are advanced scientific inventions.
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX3A",I have thought of that… [pause]Which is why I asked Meredith to take a look inside one. [pause]Apparently they look totally normal.
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX3B",I mean, is magic real here? [pause]I don’t exactly see wizards flying around shooting spells at each other.
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX3C",You and me both.
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX4",As far as I can tell, these cassette players are just regular old-fashioned cassette players. My old man used to have one that looked similar.
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX6",So I guess that’s why I ask if you think a world can have its own logic. 
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX8",What a concept! I’m definitely using that in my story…
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX8_OPTION1",Your story?
"FELIX_SOCIAL2_FELIX9",It’s no big deal right now… Just some ideas I’m playing round with. 
"FELIX_SOCIAL3_FELIX1",I’ve been thinking about what Kuneko said.
"FELIX_SOCIAL3_FELIX3_OPTION1",What’s up with them?
"FELIX_SOCIAL3_FELIX4",The monsters here have traffic cones on their backs, trash cans for bodies and televisions for heads...
"FELIX_SOCIAL3_FELIX5_OPTION1",Sounds pretty fantastical.
"FELIX_SOCIAL3_FELIX6",If this process IS real, then maybe it’s also not an exact science. [pause]Maybe it’s chaotic, and unpredictable.
"FELIX_SOCIAL3_FELIX8",Maybe sometimes all it takes is a pencil sketch that a dork in Canada drew when he was a kid.
"FELIX_SOCIAL3_FELIX9",Maybe I’m starting to understand this world a bit more.
"FELIX_SOCIAL3_FELIX10",Cool. [pause]Shall we finish up here?
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX1",Hey, {player}.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX2_OPTION1",Sure!
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX3",I hope you’ll like it!
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX4",FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX4

"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX8",FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX8
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX9",It’s a loose adaptation of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, which is a medieval story about a knight of King Arthur’s court who makes a similar journey.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX10_OPTION1",Where the story takes you?
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX11",Well, I create the characters, but who [wave amp=30 freq=10]they[/wave] are determines where the story goes.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX13",And down to you of course. You’re my inspiration after all.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX13_OPTION1",What?!
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX14",C’mon…
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX16",That’s {player} all over.
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX16_OPTION1",You’re a good friend, Felix!
"FELIX_SOCIAL4_FELIX_NO",No worries. Another time, maybe.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO1_KAYLEIGH1",I have a question for you, {player}. [pause]It’s a big one.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO1_KAYLEIGH3",Are you… [pause][pause][pause]a dog person or a cat person?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO1_KAYLEIGH3_OPTION_DOG",Dog person!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO1_DOG_KAYLEIGH1",A grand choice! [pause]Me too. 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO1_CAT_KAYLEIGH1",Interesting!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO1_FERRET_KAYLEIGH1",A ferret, aye? [pause]The choice of the fence-sitter!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO10_KAYLEIGH1",I wonder what life is like for the citizens of Harbourtown who were born here.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO11_KAYLEIGH1",“The arrow of time only moves forward, Kayleigh.”
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO11_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1",The arrow of… what?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO11_KAYLEIGH2",Oh, it’s just something my dad used to say.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO11_KAYLEIGH3",I guess it means that time marches on - we can’t turn back the clock and change our mistakes, so we shouldn’t dwell on the past.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO11_KAYLEIGH6",I guess that means we should be thinking about the next step in our adventure! After all, the arrow of time only moves forward, {player}!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO12_KAYLEIGH1",[wave amp=30 freq=10]So…[/wave] [pause]You and Meredith, [pause]huh?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO12_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1",You heard…?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO12_KAYLEIGH2",I guess after we [wave amp=30 freq=10]kissed[/wave], maybe I just had the wrong impression of what “we” were.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO12_KAYLEIGH4",You and Meredith get on well, though. I can totally see you two together.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO12_KAYLEIGH5",A word of advice between friends, though -[pause] maybe you [wave amp=30 freq=10]shouldn’t[/wave] tell her she’s not the only girl on this island that you’ve kissed.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO13_KAYLEIGH1",If that gateway [wave amp=30 freq=10]does[/wave] take us back to our old worlds, will we all have to say goodbye?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO13_KAYLEIGH2",...
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO13_KAYLEIGH3",Fortunately, we still have stuff to do here on New Wirral. I’ll worry about all that later!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO13_KAYLEIGH4",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO13_KAYLEIGH4
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO14_KAYLEIGH1",So I guess Ianthe knows about the gateway now, too!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO15_KAYLEIGH1",When we fought Aleph on the train… [pause]the force we summoned by fusing…
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO15_KAYLEIGH2_OPTION1",Yeah!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO15_KAYLEIGH3",I don’t quite fully understand it, but it felt like we embodied something that aligned with her goals in that moment. It wasn’t just us in that form - [wave amp=30 freq=10]she[/wave] fused with us as well.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO16_KAYLEIGH1",Hey, I forgot to ask! How are you feeling about taking on the [wave amp=30 freq=10]ranger training[/wave], {player}?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO16_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO16_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO16_KAYLEIGH2",Of course you are! You’ll do fine!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO16_KAYLEIGH3",The rangers tailor their challenges to the strengths of each trainee - my training involved doing community work around town for each ranger captain.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO16_KAYLEIGH4",Your combat challenge seems… [pause]a little more intense than mine.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO17_KAYLEIGH1",The thing with the rangers is that each one has a special role they play in maintaining the town.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO17_KAYLEIGH3",But these also reflect how they battle! Each of them has a unique tactic they’ll use.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO18_KAYLEIGH1",I think… if I do get to go back home, I’ll need to put all my ranger skills into action.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO18_KAYLEIGH2_OPTION1",What was your life like before?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO18_KAYLEIGH3",Uhh… [pause]I wasn’t living what you’d call an [wave amp=30 freq=10]exciting[/wave] life.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO18_KAYLEIGH5",It was pleasant, [pause]but after everything I’ve been through on this island? I’m not sure that would satisfy me anymore.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO19_KAYLEIGH1",I am glad we still get to still do our camping trips together, {player}.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO19_KAYLEIGH4",Like I said after we first fought Morgante - we’re in this together, you and I!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO2_KAYLEIGH1",This might sound weird, but…
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO20_KAYLEIGH1",So tell me - how do you feel about sleeping in the [wave amp=30 freq=10]great outdoors[/wave]?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO20_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1",I love camping!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO20_KAYLEIGH2",Brilliant! [pause]You’re in luck then - New Wirral doesn’t exactly have any hotels, so you’ll probably be doing a lot of your sleeping in a tent.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO20_KAYLEIGH3",That’s… [pause]unfortunate. You might have to get used to sleeping in a tent if you’re going to be exploring the island - New Wirral doesn't exactly have a local hotel franchise, or anything.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO21_KAYLEIGH1",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO21_KAYLEIGH1
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO21_KAYLEIGH2",It was “Candevil”, right? That’s a pretty fun monster form! When I’ve used it in the past, I felt like I was on a permanent sugar rush.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO21_KAYLEIGH4",It was “Bansheep”, right? That’s a pretty cute monster form! When I’ve used it in the past, I had to get used to the weird sensation of floating.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO21_KAYLEIGH6",It takes some time getting used to how each monster form changes how your own body feels. It seems to me that you’re doing a cracking job at learning the ropes, though!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO22_KAYLEIGH1",That Archangel we fought… [pause]Morgante, right?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO22_KAYLEIGH3_OPTION1",I hadn’t considered that.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO22_KAYLEIGH4",It makes me feel like us humans are [wave amp=30 freq=10]pretty[/wave] puny in comparison…
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO3_KAYLEIGH1",Do you think… New Wirral can physically change us?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO4_KAYLEIGH1",I do kinda miss the cafés where they’d write your name on a cup.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO5_KAYLEIGH1",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO5_KAYLEIGH1
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO5_KAYLEIGH2",Things really could be worse, couldn’t they?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO6_KAYLEIGH1",I used to go camping a lot when I was a kid. Ireland has a bunch of great places to camp out!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO6_KAYLEIGH3",Camping with you makes me nostalgic for that time.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO7_KAYLEIGH1",This might sound weird, [pause]but…
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO8_KAYLEIGH1",I do wonder how the whole [pause]”cassette tape monster transforming” thing works.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_CONVO9_KAYLEIGH1",Who knew that being in a relationship would involve so many coffee breaks?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_DATING_1",You and Kayleigh discuss fond memories of places you visited as children.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_DATING_2",The two of you laugh over embarrassing moments you’ve experienced.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_DATING_3",Kayleigh discusses her aspirations with you.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_DATING_4",The two of you have a light-hearted conversation about your romantic histories.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_DATING_5",Kayleigh chats to you about the places on earth she’d like to visit.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_PLATONIC_1",Kayleigh engages you with an enthusiastic discussion on your favourite dog breeds.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_PLATONIC_2",You and Kayleigh casually discuss the mysteries of New Wirral.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_PLATONIC_3",Kayleigh tells you a funny anecdote about her life.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_PLATONIC_4",Kayleigh tells you about her various ventures helping out the people of Harbourtown.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_PLATONIC_5",The two of you have fun throwing twigs into the campfire.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH1",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH1
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1",[color=#f382c5]I want us to be together.[/color]
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH2",Aye, I thought you might. 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH3",Truth be told, I don’t think I saw you in [wave amp=30 freq=30]that[/wave] way until we fused. 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH4",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH4
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH5",It may sound a wee bit silly, but when we fuse…
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH6",I feel like I [wave amp=30 freq=10]feel[/wave] your soul… [pause]And that maybe I know you in a way I don’t even know myself.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH8",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH8
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH10",You’re right.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH12",Well, you have a girlfriend now! AND she’s a budding musician!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_ROMANCE_KAYLEIGH_NO",If you say so!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH1",So, I’ve been having a bit of a think recently. 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH3",So much of my time was spent trying to keep people happy...
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH6",Otherwise I’ll just burn myself out. 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH7_OPTION1",Well, what things do you like to do in your own time?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH8",I… Will have to think about that!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH11",Did you know I used to play guitar? 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH12_OPTION1",How did he fit both you and a guitar on his lap at the same time?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH13",...Very carefully.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH14",I bought my own guitar in my teens, but was never particularly good at it. 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH16_OPTION1",That’s a shame!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH17",You know what, [pause]you’re right.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH19",I should do more “me” stuff!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH21_OPTION1",That’s the spirit!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH22",Heh. Thanks a million, {player}.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL1_KAYLEIGH25",I’m pretty much finished with my cup of tea. What do you say, shall we get back to it, then?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH1",Check it out, {player}!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH2_OPTION1",Is it in good condition?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH3",It… Has a bit of a seawater aroma to it…
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH4_OPTION1",How does it sound?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH5",RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH5
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH6",That sounds like…
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH7",A real work in progress!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH8",Don’t worry, everyone in New Wirral is used to things being a bit broken. Nothing a bit of elbow grease can’t fix!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH10",You’ll be hearing me play this beauty in no time!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH10_OPTION1",I’m looking forward to it!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH11A",Me too!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL2_KAYLEIGH11B",Cross your fingers and maybe it’ll come true.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_KAYLEIGH1",Hey, uh, do you wanna come on over to my place? I have something I wanted to show you.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1",Sure!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_KAYLEIGH2A",Brilliant!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_KAYLEIGH3",I-I wanted to play you something. My dad used to sing this to me, and it was the first song I ever learned to play.
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_KAYLEIGH5_OPTION1",Yeah!
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_KAYLEIGH6",So, what did you think?
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_KAYLEIGH6_OPTION1",That was amazing! 
"RESTING_KAYLEIGH_SOCIAL3_KAYLEIGH2B",No problem – I guess I have more time to practice then!
"MEREDITH_CONVO1_MEREDITH1",Y’know…
"MEREDITH_CONVO10_MEREDITH1",If we do get to go back to our worlds, I’m gonna have so many movies to catch up on.
"MEREDITH_CONVO10_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",Movies?
"MEREDITH_CONVO10_MEREDITH2",Oh, [pause]hmm.
"MEREDITH_CONVO10_MEREDITH3_OPTION1",That’s very specific.
"MEREDITH_CONVO10_MEREDITH4",It’s good to know what appeals to you, I guess.
"MEREDITH_CONVO11_MEREDITH1",So I heard Kayleigh is like, your girlfriend now…?
"MEREDITH_CONVO11_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",You heard…?
"MEREDITH_CONVO11_MEREDITH2",What can I say? Word gets around. 
"MEREDITH_CONVO11_MEREDITH5",(God, I’m such a [wave amp=30 freq=10]mess[/wave] when talking to women...)
"MEREDITH_CONVO11_MEREDITH6",Maybe I just got the wrong idea after that night we spent together… [pause]but it’s OK.
"MEREDITH_CONVO11_MEREDITH7",I’m not sure I’m ready for any long-term commitments anyway, mate.
"MEREDITH_CONVO12_MEREDITH1",Remember when we fought the Archangel that lived under the mall? [pause]I was thinking about something it said.
"MEREDITH_CONVO12_MEREDITH4",I guess it’s easy to get so fixated on that stuff that you neglect the things in life that [wave amp=30 freq=10]truly[/wave] matter.
"MEREDITH_CONVO12_MEREDITH6",And, uh, our friendship matters to me, [pause]so I’ll make sure to remember that.
"MEREDITH_CONVO13_MEREDITH1",Remember when we travelled through that graveyard? It got me thinking.
"MEREDITH_CONVO13_MEREDITH3",That’s a lot of people who were lost, and never found, y’know? That’s pretty sad to think about.
"MEREDITH_CONVO14_MEREDITH1",So… do you believe it’s true?
"MEREDITH_CONVO14_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",Do I believe what?
"MEREDITH_CONVO14_MEREDITH2",That the big gateway you found can take us home?
"MEREDITH_CONVO14_MEREDITH2_OPTION1",I have to.
"MEREDITH_CONVO14_MEREDITH3",I… [pause]resigned myself to being here forever. It’s a little scary to have to start thinking of a future for myself.
"MEREDITH_CONVO15_MEREDTH1",You spoke to Ianthe about the gateway, huh?
"MEREDITH_CONVO15_MEREDTH2_OPTION1",What do you mean?
"MEREDITH_CONVO15_MEREDTH3",People here are gonna have to shift their entire outlooks. New Wirral won’t be this place that traps you forever anymore. It'll be a place some people simply… end up, from time to time.
"MEREDITH_CONVO15_MEREDTH6",I’m glad I’m not one of them. Too much work.
"MEREDITH_CONVO16_MEREDITH1",So much has happened recently, we haven’t even had a chance to talk about our big battle against Aleph.
"MEREDITH_CONVO16_MEREDITH3",That was bloody mental.
"MEREDITH_CONVO17_MEREDITH1",I think I was worried at first that a relationship might fundamentally change me.
"MEREDITH_CONVO17_MEREDITH4",But… it didn’t happen. I’m still [wave amp=30 freq=10]me[/wave], [pause]I just have [wave amp=30 freq=10]you[/wave] as well.
"MEREDITH_CONVO18_MEREDITH1",I thought the monsters of New Wirral were creepy enough…
"MEREDITH_CONVO18_MEREDITH5",Well, I guess I won’t sleep easy tonight knowing that.
"MEREDITH_CONVO19_MEREDITH1",...
"MEREDITH_CONVO19_MEREDITH3",Sorry, I know this is awkward. We don’t really know each other that well, so there’s not a huge amount for us to talk about.
"MEREDITH_CONVO19_MEREDITH4",Oh. [pause]Maybe pointing it out is just making it worse.
"MEREDITH_CONVO2_MEREDITH1",Do you remember what you were doing right before you came here?
"MEREDITH_CONVO20_MEREDITH1",I’m not… [pause]super big on camping. I’m more of an “inside” person.
"MEREDITH_CONVO20_MEREDITH3",I hope you’re not regretting your past decision to go searching for a vinyl record with a total stranger, mate.
"MEREDITH_CONVO21_MEREDITH1",Back in the café once more… some things never change, do they?
"MEREDITH_CONVO21_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",Do you come here often?
"MEREDITH_CONVO21_MEREDITH2",This is Harbourtown. There’s literally [wave amp=30 freq=10]nowhere[/wave] else to hang out.
"MEREDITH_CONVO22_MEREDITH1",So, uh, you do a lot of camping here on New Wirral, don’t you?
"MEREDITH_CONVO22_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",I guess so!
"MEREDITH_CONVO22_MEREDITH2",Seems like it to me. Have you kissed all your [wave amp=30 freq=10]other[/wave] camping mates?
"MEREDITH_CONVO22_MEREDITH2_OPTION1",N-no!
"MEREDITH_CONVO22_MEREDITH3",MEREDITH_CONVO22_MEREDITH3
"MEREDITH_CONVO23_MEREDITH1",MEREDITH_CONVO23_MEREDITH1
"MEREDITH_CONVO23_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",Yeah!
"MEREDITH_CONVO23_MEREDITH2",I wanna know… [pause]what’s her whole [wave amp=30 freq=10]deal[/wave]?
"MEREDITH_CONVO23_MEREDITH2_OPTION1",What do you mean?
"MEREDITH_CONVO23_MEREDITH3",She turned up in Harbourtown about a year ago, and went straight into training with the rangers. [pause]She didn’t seem to need [wave amp=30 freq=10]any[/wave] time to adjust to being stuck on this island.
"MEREDITH_CONVO23_MEREDITH6",MEREDITH_CONVO23_MEREDITH6
"MEREDITH_CONVO3_MEREDITH1",I wonder…
"MEREDITH_CONVO4_MEREDITH1",The cool thing about The Witch House is that like, [pause]three other bands had to disband for them to form.
"MEREDITH_CONVO5_MEREDITH1",UGH. [pause][pause]I think something just crawled on my foot.
"MEREDITH_CONVO6_MEREDITH1",Coming here for our “couple time” is fine, but…
"MEREDITH_CONVO6_MEREDITH3",That would change the dating game entirely! 
"MEREDITH_CONVO7_MEREDITH1",So I’m, uh, not super good at expressing myself.
"MEREDITH_CONVO7_MEREDITH4",And a lot of people DO bore me! 
"MEREDITH_CONVO7_MEREDITH5",But you never do, [pause]so please don’t ever think I’m not paying attention or anything.
"MEREDITH_CONVO8_MEREDITH1",Have you noticed how Harbourtown provides for everyone, no matter what they bring to the community?
"MEREDITH_CONVO9_MEREDITH1",This might be a bit morbid, but I do sometimes wonder if people from my “previous life” ever think about me.
"MEREDITH_CONVO9_MEREDITH4",That actually sounds much more depressing when I say it out loud like that.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_DATING_1",Meredith describes to you in great detail a horror movie she once saw on television.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_DATING_2",You and Meredith discuss places you’d like to visit one day.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_DATING_3",Meredith works up the courage to compliment your appearance.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_DATING_4",The two of you have a personal and intimate conversation.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_DATING_5",You compliment Meredith and it greatly embarrasses her. She appreciates it, though.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_PLATONIC_1",Meredith makes small-talk with you.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_PLATONIC_2",You try to make small-talk with Meredith, but she’s not very talkative at the moment.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_PLATONIC_3",Meredith complains about some minor grievances in her day while you listen.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_PLATONIC_4",Meredith eagerly recounts the plot of a fantasy novel she adores.
"RESTING_MEREDITH_PLATONIC_5",The two of you sit quietly. Meredith doesn’t have much to say right now.
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH1",MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH1
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",[color=#f382c5]I want us to be together.[/color]
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH2",I…
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH6_OPTION1",I am.
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH7",Screw it. [pause]Why not? 
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH8",MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH8
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH9",It’s always been easier for me to tell myself that I need to be happier with myself before I get into a relationship with someone, [pause]but I think the truth is…
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH11",But you make me happy, [pause]and I'm more whole when I’m with you than I am without.
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH12",Th-that’s enough sappiness from me. [pause]Oh, and I can’t do cute-talk. 
"MEREDITH_ROMANCE_MEREDITH_NO",Uh, [pause]OK.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH1",With both the Archangels appearing and us fusing for the first time, things have suddenly gotten very strange in my life lately.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",Strange?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH2",Don’t take that the wrong way! Fusing with you is cool. But it’s [wave amp=30 freq=10]weird[/wave], right?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH15",It’s been so long since I arrived here, I’ve barely thought about going back.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH18",When I arrived here, I kind of got obsessed with electronics. Making lights and stuff for the town. 
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH21",Urgh. [pause]Sorry for being such a… [pause]Sorry for being me, I guess.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH21_OPTION1",You don’t have to apologise!
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH22",Heh. [pause]Thanks. [pause]For a second, I sounded like Kayleigh there. 
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH23",Do you know what I mean? She always acts like she’s got something to apologise for.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL1_MEREDITH24",That’s enough sincerity. 
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH1",The Gramophone café always reminds me of my dad. [pause]He’d brew a pot of coffee every morning before heading into London for work, [pause]so that coffee smell is kind of seared into my brain. 
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",Sounds nostalgic!
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH2",I guess so...
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH5_OPTION1",That’s sad.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH6",I suppose it is.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH12",Well, there’s still time to see how I do at this.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH13",Maybe I just need to make more friends whilst I’m here in New Wirral. [pause]Urgh.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH14_OPTION1",MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH14_OPTION1
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH15",It’s easier with us – we have, [pause]like, [pause]a hobby together.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH15_OPTION1",A... hobby?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH16",Yeah, [pause]we’re looking for a magic world portal. [pause]That’s a hobby, right?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH16_OPTION1",I guess so!
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH17",MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH17
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH17_OPTION1",Of course we would!
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH18A",Heh. Cool.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH18B",Urgh, you [wave amp=30 freq=10]can’t[/wave] compliment me like that. [pause]I totally don’t handle it well.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH20",Huh, [pause]I’m more tired than I thought.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL2_MEREDITH21",Do you think transforming and battling counts as exercise? [pause]I guess it’s pretty exhausting.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH1",Y’know, all that stuff with the vinyl record I was looking for got me thinking.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",What about?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH2",Well, let me put it this way:
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH4_OPTION1",I guess that makes sense!
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH5",So like, [pause]when I was a teenager, I was a big fan of this old fantasy author. [pause]I was a huge dork.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH6",Every book he wrote wasn’t just a story, it was like peering into his mind. [pause]His aspirations, his beliefs, his philosophies…
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH8",Eventually I read everything he’d ever written when he was alive, and the finality of it stuck with me.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH11",But if there’s infinite worlds, then maybe there’s an endless list of different books he ended up writing.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH13",Maybe we never really die, [pause]in a sense.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL3_MEREDITH14",Just something that’s been on my mind, is all.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH1",MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH1
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH3",Movie night. [pause]At my place. [pause]Are you in?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH3_OPTION1",Sure!
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH5",Alright, you’re gonna love this.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH6",So check this out – the only working movie projector on New Wirral.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH6_OPTION1",Amazing!
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH7",It’s been one of my many side-hobbies.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH8",It’s time I tell you about New Wirral’s unspoken curse.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH9",You see this? 
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH15",Guess what?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH17",[shake rate=30 level=10]Every single tape is Blood Puncher.[/shake]
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH19",So guess what we’re watching?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH19_OPTION1",Sounds like my kind of movie!
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH20",That’s the spirit.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH21",I wanted to say, [pause]thanks for hanging out with me.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH22_OPTION1",MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH22_OPTION1
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_MEREDITH1",Heh. Me too, {player}.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_MEREDITH2",MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_PLATONIC_MEREDITH2
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_MEREDITH1",[pause].[pause].[pause].
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_MEREDITH2",Took you long enough to ask.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_MEREDITH5",Why not? Date night. With a bad movie.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_MEREDITH6",Can we keep things casual? [pause]Like, [pause]non-committal?
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_MEREDITH7",I’ve, [pause]uh, [pause]only ever been with guys before – [pause]so this is also kinda new to me.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_MEREDITH8",I want to hang out with you still… 
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_MEREDITH9",But I also want to make out with you sometimes.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_ROMANTIC_MEREDITH11",So… we don’t have to do much watching.
"MEREDITH_SOCIAL4_MEREDITH4",Boo. Give me a shout when you’re up for it. It should be a laugh.
"VIOLA_CONVO1_VIOLA1",...So you mean to tell me that in your realm, [pause]travelling from one country to another takes hours, [pause]and not days?
"VIOLA_CONVO10_VIOLA1",VIOLA_CONVO10_VIOLA1
"VIOLA_CONVO10_VIOLA1_OPTION1",You were a what?
"VIOLA_CONVO10_VIOLA2",Yes! [pause]My brother and I would sing and act for friends and various audiences, on occasion.
"VIOLA_CONVO10_VIOLA3",We did not need the money, of course. [pause]Finances were of little worry for most of my life. The merriment was its own reward.
"VIOLA_CONVO10_VIOLA4",Tell me; you must have concealed talents of your own. [pause]I greatly wish to know more about you, if you’ll permit…
"VIOLA_CONVO11_VIOLA1",VIOLA_CONVO11_VIOLA1
"VIOLA_CONVO12_VIOLA1",I hope we soon find our way home from the strange dream we find ourselves in.
"VIOLA_CONVO13_VIOLA1",...
"VIOLA_CONVO13_VIOLA2",VIOLA_CONVO13_VIOLA2
"VIOLA_CONVO14_VIOLA1",I am thinking once again of the words of the trickster Robin Goodfellow.
"VIOLA_CONVO14_VIOLA5",Perhaps in one realm, one may find the “Book of {player}”! [pause]I am sure it is a riveting read!
"VIOLA_CONVO15_VIOLA1",Tell me, [pause]{player}, [pause]do you not find this land’s methods of dueling in the guise of fae beasts to be a strange one?
"VIOLA_CONVO15_VIOLA1_OPTION1",It is pretty weird, yeah!
"VIOLA_CONVO15_VIOLA2",So curious it is! And yet the kind people of this land do it without a moment’s hesitation or worry.
"VIOLA_CONVO16_VIOLA1",Do you believe it, {player}? [pause]Do you believe that the doorway you found will lead us back to where we once lived?
"VIOLA_CONVO16_VIOLA1_OPTION1",I have to!
"VIOLA_CONVO16_VIOLA2",Wonderful! [pause]As much as I have come to admire this brave new world, I know that it is not any of our fates to remain here forever.
"VIOLA_CONVO16_VIOLA3",But if it is your wish to remain here but a while longer, I shall stay also. [pause]We are young, after all. Time does not beckon us to be gone from this place as of yet.
"VIOLA_CONVO17_VIOLA1",The battle with our foe Aleph was a grand one, was it not?
"VIOLA_CONVO17_VIOLA1_OPTION1",Yeah!
"VIOLA_CONVO17_VIOLA2",I am more of a fighter than I thought. Perhaps I should instead live the life of a soldier!
"VIOLA_CONVO17_VIOLA3",Though as a woman, I would not be permitted to do so. [pause]Perhaps I should once again disguise myself as a man…
"VIOLA_CONVO17_VIOLA3_OPTION1",”Again?”
"VIOLA_CONVO17_VIOLA4",Does this surprise you? I am a performer at heart! Man and woman are merely costumes in my wardrobe, to wear as I will.
"VIOLA_CONVO18_VIOLA1",VIOLA_CONVO18_VIOLA1
"VIOLA_CONVO18_VIOLA2",Perhaps that is the true purpose of this land: those who step foot upon its shores are fated to leave with many tales of their adventures.
"VIOLA_CONVO19_VIOLA1",VIOLA_CONVO19_VIOLA1
"VIOLA_CONVO19_VIOLA1_OPTION1",Yeah!
"VIOLA_CONVO19_VIOLA2",I am glad to hear it!
"VIOLA_CONVO19_VIOLA3",It is no matter – perhaps I shall teach you!
"VIOLA_CONVO19_VIOLA4",As much as man needs the cook to nourish their stomach, so too do they need the poet to nourish their heart.
"VIOLA_CONVO19_VIOLA6",Given our present union, perhaps we would do well to enjoy the works of the Greek poet Sappho? I shall attempt to locate a book of her poetry in our travels.
"VIOLA_CONVO2_VIOLA1",I have not been in this land for long, [pause]but find myself missing my home so dearly.
"VIOLA_CONVO20_VIOLA1",Thank you – [pause]this moment of rest has not gone unappreciated, {player}.
"VIOLA_CONVO3_VIOLA1",I know that the sky above us is not the same one I would watch from my chamber window as a child…
"VIOLA_CONVO3_VIOLA3",I am sure part of you must feel the same, [pause]{player}.
"VIOLA_CONVO4_VIOLA1",Tell me: [pause]what is the name of the monstrous form you wear in battle?
"VIOLA_CONVO5_VIOLA1",It has occurred to me that this island brings together unlikely bedfellows.
"VIOLA_CONVO5_VIOLA3",VIOLA_CONVO5_VIOLA3
"VIOLA_CONVO6_VIOLA1",If I were to one day leave this place, I would be foolish to speak a word of my time here.
"VIOLA_CONVO7_VIOLA1",VIOLA_CONVO7_VIOLA1
"VIOLA_CONVO8_VIOLA1",I have visited many a tavern in my home country, yet none held such a quietness as this place.
"VIOLA_CONVO8_VIOLA2",It is enjoyable! [pause]I can envision many a happy time has been spent within these walls.
"VIOLA_CONVO9_VIOLA1",When the trees stand still for a moment, and a quiet briefly settles across this land…
"RESTING_VIOLA_DATING_1",Viola recites some beautiful poetry she once studied. Her performance is beautiful.
"RESTING_VIOLA_DATING_2",The two of you exchange some cute pleasantries.
"RESTING_VIOLA_DATING_3",Viola tells you about her aspirations in a rather personal conversation.
"RESTING_VIOLA_PLATONIC_1",Viola tells you tales of her adventures as a child.
"RESTING_VIOLA_PLATONIC_2",Viola tells you of the beauty of her home country of Messaline.
"RESTING_VIOLA_PLATONIC_3",Viola asks eagerly about what your life was like before you came to New Wirral.
"RESTING_VIOLA_PLATONIC_4",You tell Viola about life back on your world.
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA1",VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA1
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA1_OPTION1",[color=#f382c5]I want us to be together.[/color]
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA2",I…
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA5",I jest. [pause]We are time’s subjects, [pause]and one day time will bid us gone from each other’s company.
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA6",It would be too much to bear to marry you, [pause]knowing that one day this waking dream will end and we shall return to our lives as they once were.
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA7",Yet, [pause]there still remains many days and nights by each other’s side.
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA8",I agree to your wish. [pause]Henceforth, we share a union of hearts.
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA9",Perhaps, [pause]in another realm far beyond our imaginings, [pause]a humble playwright is telling our tale as we speak.
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA11",I believe it would make for a wonderful story, [pause]don’t you think?
"VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA_NO",VIOLA_ROMANCE_VIOLA_NO
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA1",It has become apparent to me, [pause]as of late, [pause]that many elements of life in this town are foreign to me.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA3",And lamplights illuminate themselves with no lamplighter! [pause]There is much I do not understand.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA3_OPTION1",I suppose you do come from a Shakespearean past…
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA4",Yes. And these “cassette players” you use to take the form of spirits and beasts.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA5_OPTION1",Uh, no, that’s still weird.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA6",I see.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA8",It is true: I am indeed a long way from Messaline, both in time and place.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA9",If this realm has delights unfamiliar to me, I ask of you this:
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA10",Perhaps you may share some of these with me, in time?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA11_OPTION1",Before you return home?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA12",Is it not your quest to find passage off this island?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA13",VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA13
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA15",You shall always have in me an ally and a friend.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL1_VIOLA16",Very well! [pause]Let us dally no longer.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA1",The popular establishment, [pause]the “Gramophone”...
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA2_OPTION1",That’s right!
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA3",And the people of your time consume this “coffee” in great quantities?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA3_OPTION1",They sure do!
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA4",Enlightening.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA6",As such, I have acquired a flask of this beloved beverage. [pause]A gift from Clémence.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_NARRATION7",Viola drinks a cup of coffee.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_PLAYER8_OPTION1",What is your verdict?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA9",It is a hearty drink.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA11",And as for this sugared pastry she also gave me so kindly...
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA12_OPTION1",It’s a cinnamon roll!
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA13",The flavours… [pause]The sweetness....
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA15",Goodnight, [pause]sweet roll.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA15_OPTION1",So you liked it?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL2_VIOLA16",Yes, [pause]I would say so.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL3_VIOLA1",In my efforts to learn about the many realms outside of Harbourtown, I have acquired some documents of great significance.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL3_VIOLA1_OPTION1",Learning material? 
"VIOLA_SOCIAL3_VIOLA2",Yes – [pause]my time here on New Wirral has shown me that my understanding of the world I lived in was but a grain of sand in an endless ocean...
"VIOLA_SOCIAL3_VIOLA5",She insisted that it was a valuable read, [pause]this “Spooktales” book.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL3_VIOLA5_OPTION1",I think this is a horror fiction book…
"VIOLA_SOCIAL3_VIOLA6",Indeed, I have concluded that the accounts within are imaginary.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL3_VIOLA8",Do we not fight monsters on a regular basis? [pause]Perhaps there is more that can be learned from this document than you may have first assumed.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL3_VIOLA9",Nevertheless, [pause]I think Meredith lent me this book simply out of a love of the macabre.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA1",VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA1
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA1_OPTION1",Sure!
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA2",I must say this:
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA3",The people of Harbourtown live unburdened by expectation, do they not?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA3_OPTION1",What do you mean?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA4",No lords to please, [pause]no king to kneel before…
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA5_OPTION1",Was your previous life complicated?
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA6",My family name is one of great repute and wealth, [pause]but ill fortune had fallen upon us.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA9",How easy would it be to forget my kin, and remain here.
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA11",VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA11
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA11_OPTION1",VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA11_OPTION1
"VIOLA_SOCIAL4_VIOLA_NO",Another time, then.
"CAPTAIN_BUFFY_DEFEATED_INTERACT1",100 sit-ups, 100 push-ups, 100 lunges… My latest routine is gonna give me abs so hard you could sharpen a machete on them!
"CAPTAIN_BUFFY_INTRO1",[shake rate=30 level=10]Huff… huff…[/shake] I can really feel that one in my calves...
"CAPTAIN_BUFFY_INTRO2",Hi there! I’m Bruna – my friends call me Buffy. [pause]I’m a ranger captain here in New Wirral.
"CAPTAIN_BUFFY_INTRO2_OPTION1",Are you training for something?
"CAPTAIN_BUFFY_INTRO3",You could say that I am training for battle by honing my body! We may fight here on New Wirral by turning into monsters…
"CAPTAIN_BUFFY_INTRO4",But it all starts here, with our flesh and blood! Battling requires energy, and I need to [wave amp=30 freq=10]maximise[/wave] my potential energy!

"CAPTAIN_BUFFY_POST_REWARD1",Maybe I should take a break before I pull a muscle or three...

"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_INTRO3",Sounds like an ‘orrible place! [pause]Cutthroats,[pause] highwaymen,[pause] vampires… [pause]I was bloody fascinated with it!
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_INTRO3_OPTION1",Sounds fun!
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_INTRO4",Of course, [pause]when the town burned down, all those stories were lost. [pause]Everyone and everything here went up in flames too, [pause]except little ol’ me.
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_INTRO5",Penny Dreadful, [pause]ranger captain, cheater of death, here in the flesh!
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_INTRO5_OPTION1",Cheater of death…?
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_INTRO6",The blighters in Harbourtown have a lot of different beliefs, but all agree on one thing – we’re [wave amp=30 freq=10]all[/wave] gonna kick the bucket eventually.
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_INTRO7",I think they simply lack imagination. [pause]Death isn’t the end… not if you know the [wave amp=30 freq=10]esoteric ways[/wave].
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_LAST_LEGS1",Enough of this! [shake rate=30 level=10]You need slappin’ down![/shake]
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_NOT_TRAINEE1",I could give you a demonstration, but I only scrap with registered rangers or trainees. [pause]Personal policy, sorry mate.
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_POST_BATTLE1",I’m bloody impressed. [pause]Even shifting myself from this mortal plane wasn’t enough to stop you from comin’ out on top.
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_POST_BATTLE2",Here’s your reward for defeating the [wave amp=30 freq=10]immortal Penny Dreadful![/wave]
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_POST_REMATCH1",Looks like you win again. I suppose there’s a lesson in here for both of us!
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_POST_REMATCH2",...I don’t know what the lesson is though. [pause]I’ll leave that part up to you.
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_POST_REWARD1",Remember, trainee – [pause]if life is what you make of it, then death is too!
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_POST_REWARD2",...I’m not [wave amp=30 freq=10]quite[/wave] sure what that means, [pause]but it feels profound!
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_PRE_BATTLE1",CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_PRE_BATTLE1
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_PRE_BATTLE2",Let’s crack on, then! [pause]If you expect me to go soft on you because I’m a ranger captain, you’re in for a [shake rate=30 level=10]proper fright![/shake]
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_PRE_BATTLE_NO",Not up to scratch, are we? [pause]I won’t hold it against you!
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_PRE_REMATCH1",CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_PRE_REMATCH1
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_PRE_REMATCH3",Alright then! [pause]Since we’re equals, you can expect me to hold nothin’ back this time!
"CAPTAIN_DREADFUL_PRE_REMATCH_NO",Not up to scratch, are we? [pause]I won’t hold it against you!
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_DEFEATED_INTERACT1",The exact nature of my work with the rangers must remain classified. You’re better off not knowing.
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_INTRO1",CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_INTRO1
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_INTRO2",I am Gladiola. I am a loyal captain of Ianthe’s rangers.
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_INTRO2_OPTION1",Loyal?
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_INTRO3",Much of this purgatory that we find ourselves trapped in is unknown to us. 
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_INTRO4",In this world, the shadows have claws. My job is to [wave amp=30 freq=10]scratch them back.[/wave]
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_INTRO4_OPTION1",That doesn’t make it any clearer…
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_LAST_LEGS1",You won’t cut me down so easily!
"CAPTAIN_GLADIOLA_NOT_TRAINEE1",I am forbidden from saying any more to non-rangers, however. [pause]If you ever sign up, perhaps we should talk once more.

"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_INTRO1",[wave amp=30 freq=10]This is Heather, with the weather![/wave] [pause]Today’s forecast: unpredictable as always!
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_INTRO3",For a meteorologist like myself, the climate of New Wirral is an unending puzzle!
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_LAST_LEGS1",The winds are shifting in my favour – you best believe it!
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_NOT_TRAINEE1",Uh, [pause]if you’re looking to take my ranger challenge then you’re gonna have to get registered first.
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_POST_BATTLE1",No rain or storm could hold you back, huh! You stand tall, no matter what!
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_POST_BATTLE2",Those are qualities we look for in rangers. [pause]You’ve passed my challenge with flying colours!
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_POST_REMATCH1",A thunderous victory once again! I expected nothing less from you, of course!
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_POST_REWARD1",I forecast great things in your future!
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_PRE_BATTLE1",You’re a ranger trainee, correct? [pause]If you think you can brave the storm, then why not take my ranger challenge?
"CAPTAIN_HEATHER_PRE_BATTLE2",Fabulous! [pause]I’m updating my forecast: I now predict a [shake rate=30 level=10]storm of blows[/shake] and a [shake rate=30 level=10]whirlwind victory[/shake]!

"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_EXT_IANTHE2",You ain’t moving, huh? [pause]Guess I gotta get my hands dirty, then.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_EXT_KAYLEIGH3",She’s in charge for a reason, [pause]huh...
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_EXT_EUGENE3",Momentous.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_EXT_FELIX3",Rad.

"LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_WILMA2",The stories were true! What a battle!
"LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_IANTHE3",Here – this is yours.
"LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_IANTHE4",LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_IANTHE4
"LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_IANTHE6",“How does this cassette tape thing even work? [pause]It doesn’t make any sense!”
"LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_IANTHE7",You want to know what I think? [pause]I think it makes perfect sense with the right perspective.
"LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_IANTHE10",I think that makes sense, in a way!
"LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_IANTHE11",You’ve seen the noticeboard outside the Town Hall, right? [pause]If there are any trainees who need to test their skills, I’ll leave you a message there.
"LEADER_IANTHE_POST_BATTLE_IANTHE12",For now, I’m going to take a long overdue rest. [pause]If you’re going to continue your exploration across the island, why don’t you catch up with your fellow captains?
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE1",LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE1
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE2",Well, [pause]what do you think of this outpost? [pause]This place was abandoned for the longest time. With a bit of work, we turned it into a rest stop for weary rangers.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE2_OPTION1",What do you do here?
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE3",I’d like to tell you we defend the people of New Wirral from a relentless horde of monsters…
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE4",But most of the time we’re doing odd jobs for the community. It’s really not that exciting.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_K_IANTHE1",Kayleigh can attest to that, [pause]as one of our more recent recruits!
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_K_KAYLEIGH2",[shake rate=30 level=10]W-well, {player} and I just fought an Archangel![/shake]
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_K_IANTHE3",...[pause]Is that so? We’ll have to look into this.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_K_IANTHE4",We’re pretty sure Archangels [wave amp=30 freq=10]exist[/wave], but our interactions with them have been… [pause]fleeting.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_K_KAYLEIGH5",Well, [pause]maybe we should find more! [pause]Ianthe, I think {player} should apply to be a ranger!
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_NK_IANTHE1",LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_NK_IANTHE1
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_NK_IANTHE1_OPTION1",It’s true!
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_NK_IANTHE2",We’re pretty sure Archangels [wave amp=30 freq=10]exist[/wave], but our interactions with them have been… [pause]fleeting.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_NK_EUGENE4",LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_NK_EUGENE4
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_NK_FELIX4",{player} is pretty tough.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_NK_VIOLA4",{player} fights valiantly.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE5",Well, [pause]what do you think, {player}? Do you wanna apply to join the rangers?
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE5_OPTION1",Apply?
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE6",Trainees are tasked with meeting up with each of the ranger captains here in New Wirral, and overcoming their challenges.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE7",Since you’re such a [wave amp=30 freq=10]hotshot[/wave] in monster combat, [pause]I’m pretty sure the captains are gonna want to test your fighting abilities.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE7_OPTION1",Ranger… captains?
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE8",LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE8
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE10_OPTION1",So captains are the top rangers...
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE11",Here, take one of these.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE11_OPTION1",Is this a stamp card…?
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE12",Everytime you overcome a captain’s challenge, they’ll stamp this card. [pause]When you’ve filled it all in, come see me and I can sign you off as an official ranger.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE14_OPTION1",LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE14_OPTION1
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE15",That’s the spirit.
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_MEREDITH_QUEST_IANTHE1",Now, was there anything else?
"MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY",”All I Ever Needed” by The Witch House?
"LEADER_IANTHE_INTRO_IANTHE16",Anyway, I gotta head back into town. If you need me, come swing by our headquarters.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE1",Is that so? Tell me everything.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE2",I see. So there's a train station called Night's Bridge that houses a magic mirror portal. The stations themselves are part of one giant Archangel...
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_KAYLEIGH4",That's about the gist of it.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_MEREDITH4",Uhh... Yeah.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_EUGENE4",You got it!
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_FELIX4",Heh. Pretty much.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_VIOLA4",Yes. I am glad you understand.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_DOG4",Arf!
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE5",{player}, {partner}, if it was anyone else telling me this I'd be very worried!
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE7",Honestly, I never thought this day would come.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE9",But now we can finally start to put them into motion.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE10",Most new arrivals will want to leave immediately. The rangers will guide them to ‘Night's Bridge’, of course.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE_A_1",I and the captains have already committed to staying in New Wirral to protect anyone who chooses to remain.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE_B_1",I and the captains have already committed to staying in New Wirral to protect anyone who chooses to remain.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE_C_1",I and the other captains have already committed to staying in New Wirral to protect anyone who chooses to remain.
"LEADER_IANTHE_WAY_HOME_IANTHE13",Whatever you decide, you have my full support.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL2",LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL2
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL3_OPTION1",I’ve encountered them before!
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL4A",That figures. That means you know they’re a lot tougher than the typical monsters found here on New Wirral, then.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL4B",You might have encountered them around the island in your travels – [pause]they’re wild monster fusions, often surrounded by black clouds? Can’t miss ‘em.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL5",It wasn’t always this way. Until a few years ago, fusions were an oddity.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL6",We don’t know where they’re coming from, or why.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL8",I don’t want to cause panic, so keep that to yourself.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL9",There is hope, though! The Fused Material we get from them gives off a faint radiation – not enough to be harmful, but...
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL11",Maybe…[pause] maybe we can even find out where they’re coming from, and stop their spread. That would be nice.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE5",{player}, is it good news?
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE6",Huh, so the Mer-Line expects us to handle the Rogue Fusion situation ourselves?
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE7",At least we have Night’s Bridge Station to retreat to if things get bad – thanks to your hard work.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE8",{player}, I said before that if you left New Wirral I wouldn’t hold it against you, and I still stand by that.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE9",But if you decide to stick around a bit longer, the work I have for you is literally never-ending.
"LEADER_IANTHE_MENU",Hey, {player}. Something on your mind?
"LEADER_IANTHE_MENU_FOUND_WAY_HOME",I’ve found the way home!
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE1",Do you have a completed stamp card to show me, perhaps?
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE1_OPTION1",Here it is!
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE2",So the chatter was correct! You haven’t been here long, but you’ve already shown a real knack for traversing the island and overcoming any obstacle.
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE3",LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE3
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_KAYLEIGH4",Brilliant! You’ve earned this, {player}!

"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_EUGENE4",LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_EUGENE4

"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_VIOLA4",LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_VIOLA4
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_DOG4",Awooo!
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE5",I’m afraid we don’t have any special ceremonies to mark the occasion. [pause]We’re too busy training new recruits so that we can deal with those rogue fusions.
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE6",Y’know…
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE7_OPTION1",I have!
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE8",If you’re interested, there’s one final challenge – [pause]you have to defeat [wave amp=30 freq=10]me[/wave] in combat.
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE9",LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE9
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE9_OPTION_YES",Sure!
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE9_OPTION_NO",Not now.
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_FINISHED_IANTHE_NO",No problem. Come talk to me again if you change your mind.
"LEADER_IANTHE_CAPTAINS_UNFINISHED_IANTHE1",We station the captains all around the island so that there’s always [wave amp=30 freq=10]somebody[/wave] nearby if there’s a sudden emergency.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL1",Rogue Fusions drop it. Maybe Archangels do too – I’m not sure.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSED_MATERIAL_NOT_CAPTAIN",As for why we’re asking rangers to collect it... Well, let the captains worry about that. Just focus on passing your training for now.
"LEADER_IANTHE_ELEMENTAL_TYPES_IANTHE1",Have you been paying attention to the elemental types of your monster forms?
"LEADER_IANTHE_ELEMENTAL_TYPES_IANTHE6",Oh, I almost forgot! [pause]A lot of moves, such as “Smack” and “Spit”, don’t have an innate element themselves – they will instead depend on whatever element their user is.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSION_IANTHE1",Fusion… [pause]it’s rarely been achieved. I have my theories on what allows two people to fuse, but I’m not certain.
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSION_IANTHE3_OPTION1",Who have you fused with?
"LEADER_IANTHE_FUSION_IANTHE6",Don’t you worry about that!
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_TURN_IN",LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_TURN_IN
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_ITEMS_IANTHE1",This is for you!
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_ANA_IANTHE1",The last batch you gave me proved extremely useful. Captain Lodestein tells me his [wave amp=30 freq=10]ground-penetrating Fusion Radar[/wave] is already picking up a signal deep under Dino Quarry, in the Deadlands.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_ANA_IANTHE3",Speaking of fusions, there’s been a, uh, new development...
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_ANA_IANTHE4",Some kind of new, unstable fusion has been popping up all over. “Anathema” is what we’ve been calling it.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_ANA_IANTHE6",I’ll send a few your way via the noticeboard. Would you mind taking a look?
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_ANA_IANTHE7",And of course, don’t forget to exchange your Fused Material with Ranger Wilma.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_EGG_IANTHE1",By the way, have you seen any…[pause] giant floating orbs recently?
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_EGG_IANTHE1_OPTION1",What!?
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_EGG_IANTHE2",It was a strange report from one of our new trainees. He [wave amp=30 freq=30]did[/wave] have a head injury though, so maybe it’s nothing.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_EGG_IANTHE3",Keep an eye on your Fusion Radar, just in case.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_FR_IANTHE1",Anyway, with all this Fused Material you’ve gathered, I can have Captain Lodestein install Fusion Radar into a few of the magnetic pylons on the island.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_FR_IANTHE3",Check your map. It’ll show you where Rogue Fusions can be found.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_FR_IANTHE4",This version of Fusion Radar doesn’t penetrate very deep into the ground, and it’s not 100% reliable, but I’m sure that you’ll be able to make good use of it.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_FR_IANTHE5",Anyway, don’t forget to exchange your Fused Material with Ranger Wilma. It won’t be much use just sitting in your pockets!
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE1",Do you remember the signal under Dino Quarry I told you Captain Lodestein’s Fusion Radar had picked up?
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE2",Well, I had Captain Wallace excavate it, and it looks like another of those train stations that have been popping up everywhere.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE3",Judging by the strength of the signal in this station, it could be the source of all the Anathema and Rogue Fusions!
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE4",LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_HELIA_IANTHE4
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_STARTER_IANTHE1",I believe Kayleigh has something for you.
"LEADER_IANTHE_NOTICEBOARD_STARTER_KAYLEIGH2",Well, I recorded this tape a little while ago, and it reminded me of the day we first met.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_DEFEATED_INTERACT1",Maybe I should head back to Harbourtown for a tactical “supply restock”…
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_INTRO1",CAPTAIN_JUDAS_INTRO1
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_INTRO1_OPTION1",Uhh… OK.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_INTRO2",Judas Knight. [pause]Ranger captain, survivalist expert.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_INTRO3",My job is to stay alive, no matter what. [pause]That’s easier said than done when you have to do your “surviving” on an island [shake rate=30 level=10]crawling[/shake] with vicious predators.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_INTRO5",When you’re staring a monster dead in the eyes, the only way you’re coming out alive is if you know the battle is already won.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_LAST_LEGS1",You’ve lasted longer than I thought you would. [pause]Not bad.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_NOT_TRAINEE1",I’d share more intel with you… but that’s classified information. [pause]If you signed up to be a ranger trainee, that’d be a different story.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_POST_BATTLE1",CAPTAIN_JUDAS_POST_BATTLE1
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_POST_REMATCH1",I thought I had covered every possible scenario this time…
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_POST_REMATCH2",I lost again, [pause]but I won’t shed any tears over it. [pause]Crying is a waste of body moisture, and I’m running low on water rations.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_POST_REWARD1",These are dangerous times. [pause]Civilisation and security are fleeting notions – if you can’t survive out in the field with nothing but your wits, then you’re letting yourself down.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_PRE_BATTLE1",Do you want a first-hand lesson in survival, then? [pause]I’ve already received intel that you’re a ranger trainee.
"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_PRE_BATTLE2",Alright, [pause]but don’t take it personally when you find yourself face down in the dirt.

"CAPTAIN_JUDAS_PRE_REMATCH1",CAPTAIN_JUDAS_PRE_REMATCH1

"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_INTRO2",...
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_INTRO4",Levi Lodestein. [pause]I work with the rangers to keep the lights on.
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_INTRO6",My educated guess is that there’s a unique kind of background electricity here on New Wirral that these pylons can conduct and store…
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_LAST_LEGS1",Shocking – [pause]you’re performing better than I thought you would! 
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_NOT_TRAINEE1",If you’re interested in helping out around the island yourself, why not go speak to Ianthe? She’ll be somewhere in New Wirral Park right about now.
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_POST_BATTLE1",That was a pretty electrifying fight, if I say so myself!
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_POST_BATTLE2",Forgive me for the puns – it’s a force of habit.
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_POST_REMATCH1",CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_POST_REMATCH1
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_POST_REWARD1",I’d really love to chat a bit longer, but unfortunately I have some maintenance work left to do here.
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_PRE_BATTLE1",Enough science talk. [pause]You’re here to take my ranger captain challenge, am I correct?
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_PRE_BATTLE2",Great! [pause]This won’t shock you to hear, but my area of expertise in battle is electricity. You’ll have to be quick on your feet if you don’t want to be struck by lightning!
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_PRE_BATTLE_NO",My mistake. I got so caught up in my spiel that I didn’t realise you were just passing by.
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_PRE_REMATCH1",CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_PRE_REMATCH1
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_PRE_REMATCH3",I’d say “I won’t go easy on you this time!”, [pause]but the truth is that I didn’t go easy on you.
"CAPTAIN_LODESTEIN_PRE_REMATCH_NO",My mistake. I got so caught up in my spiel that I didn’t realise you were just passing by.
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_DEFEATED_INTERACT1",Greetings! [pause]Are you here to sort through some junk with me?
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_INTRO1",Boy, the offworlders really make a lot of [wave amp=30 freq=10]stuff[/wave], don’t they?
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_INTRO2",Greetings! [pause]I’m Skip, one of the ranger captains of New Wirral. 
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_INTRO3",I gather and sort all the [wave amp=30 freq=10]stuff[/wave] you offworlders make that ends up here.
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_INTRO5",One world’s trash is another world’s treasure, [pause]after all!
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_LAST_LEGS1",You’re doing well so far! [pause]No promises to keep going easy on you, though!
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_NOT_TRAINEE1",Say, if you’re interested in the noble pursuit of “sorting through junk”, why not become a ranger trainee yourself?
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_POST_BATTLE1",CAPTAIN_SKIP_POST_BATTLE1
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_POST_REMATCH1",Huh… [pause]I lost again!
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_POST_REMATCH4",Deep down, I’m just a nerd… [pause]a nerd for all this [wave amp=30 freq=10]stuff[/wave]!
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_POST_REWARD1",As for me, I should get back to sorting out all this stuff. [pause]Do people from your world really own so many [wave amp=30 freq=10]things[/wave]?
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_POST_REWARD2",I can’t imagine that kind of life!
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_PRE_BATTLE1",CAPTAIN_SKIP_PRE_BATTLE1
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_PRE_BATTLE2",Wonderful! [pause]Try to have fun – and don’t get too disappointed when I beat you!
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_PRE_BATTLE_NO",No worries! [pause]I have plenty of junk to sort through, anyway!
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_PRE_REMATCH1",CAPTAIN_SKIP_PRE_REMATCH1
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_PRE_REMATCH3",Alright! [pause]This should be fun!
"CAPTAIN_SKIP_PRE_REMATCH_NO",No worries! [pause]I have plenty of junk to sort through, anyway!
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_DEFEATED_INTERACT1",I need to build a better foundation for my battle strategy…
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_INTRO1",You wanna know what [wave amp=30 freq=10]really[/wave] separates us from the monsters?
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_INTRO4",I’m Wallace, one of Harbourtown’s ranger captains. [pause]I oversee any building work on New Wirral.
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_LAST_LEGS1",I won’t be demolished so easily!
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_NOT_TRAINEE1",CAPTAIN_WALLACE_NOT_TRAINEE1
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_POST_BATTLE1",I built up my walls and you brought them [shake rate=30 level=10]right down![/shake] 
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_POST_BATTLE2",Nice work – you’ve earned this.
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_POST_REMATCH1",Despite all my efforts, my defenses still crumbled…
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_POST_REWARD1",I stumbled across that rare material while surveying the park for a building project. You can swap it at the town hall for some neat stuff.
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_PRE_BATTLE1",CAPTAIN_WALLACE_PRE_BATTLE1
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_PRE_BATTLE2",I hope your training has a strong foundation – you’re gonna need to be tough if you wanna bring down my walls!
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_PRE_BATTLE_NO",Another time, then.
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_PRE_REMATCH1",CAPTAIN_WALLACE_PRE_REMATCH1
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_PRE_REMATCH3",My walls aren’t going to fall so easily this time!
"CAPTAIN_WALLACE_PRE_REMATCH_NO",Another time, then.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_DEFEATED_INTERACT1",It’s important to get enough sleep… but how much sleep IS enough? [pause]Mankind has been searching for that answer since the dawn of history.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_NAME_SHORT",Zedd
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO4",It’s getting real difficult to “meditate” around here, what with all these Bulletinos zooming around. Any chance you could [wave amp=30 freq=10]sort that out for me?[/wave]
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO1",...
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO2",What’s that…? [pause]Sleeping? [pause]No, not at all! I was, uh, meditating. I’m Zedd, by the way.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO3",That said, it’s getting real difficult to “meditate” around here, what with all these Bulletinos zooming around. Any chance you could [wave amp=30 freq=10]sort that out for me?[/wave]
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO5",Thanks for that. Man, it shouldn’t be this hard for a [wave amp=30 freq=10]ranger captain[/wave] to get a bit of shut-eye around here!
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO_KAYLEIGH",Oh! [pause]I TOTALLY forgot you’re a ranger captain!
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO_MEREDITH",Uhh, [pause]YOU are a ranger captain?
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO_EUGENE",I didn’t think YOU would be a ranger.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO_FELIX",CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO_FELIX
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO_VIOLA",CAPTAIN_ZEDD_INTRO_VIOLA
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_LAST_LEGS1",*Yawn* [pause]How’s the fight going? Have I won yet? Oh.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_NOT_TRAINEE1",Uh, if you want to take my ranger challenge, you’re gonna need to sign up first. [pause]Come wake me up when you’ve done that, I guess.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_POST_BATTLE1",Wow, I think that final blow woke me up a bit. [pause]Here’s your reward.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_POST_REMATCH1",I lost again? This is why I don’t trust the waking world...
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_POST_REWARD1",I could do with a cup of coffee to wake me up...
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_PRE_BATTLE1",Uh, I guess you’re here to take my ranger training challenge, right? 
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_PRE_BATTLE2",*Yawn* Alright then. Let’s hit the hay – [pause]I mean, hit the battlefield. [pause]Yeah.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_PRE_BATTLE_NO",No problem. I could do with a nap, anyway.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_PRE_REMATCH1",CAPTAIN_ZEDD_PRE_REMATCH1
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_PRE_REMATCH3",*Yawn* Let’s go again, then.
"CAPTAIN_ZEDD_PRE_REMATCH_NO",No problem. I could do with a nap, anyway.
"TOWN_HALL_BUFFY_EVENT_BUFFY1",…I’m thinking that the rangers would benefit from some physical fitness classes.
"TOWN_HALL_BUFFY_EVENT_BUFFY2",We could even make it fun! [pause]How about [wave amp=30 freq=10]dance aerobics[/wave]? Cybil could provide a music playlist!
"TOWN_HALL_BUFFY_EVENT_IANTHE3",Yeah, that sounds like a cute idea! If you think you can manage it, of course.
"TOWN_HALL_BUFFY_EVENT_BUFFY4",No sweat! I used to run a cardio class every week for five years. If anyone’s up to the job, it’s [wave amp=30 freq=10]me[/wave]!
"TOWN_HALL_CLEEO_EVENT_CLEEO1",[color=#e3affe]...I simply find it difficult to sympathise with the plight of the human race.[/color]
"TOWN_HALL_CLEEO_EVENT_IANTHE2",That’s understandable. People can be… [pause]confusing. [pause]Unpredictable.
"TOWN_HALL_CLEEO_EVENT_CLEEO3",[color=#e3affe]...Nah, [pause]I disagree. Humans are [wave amp=30 freq=10]not[/wave] unpredictable. You can predict their behaviour very easily, in fact.[/color]
"TOWN_HALL_CLEEO_EVENT_CLEEO4",[color=#e3affe]Human beings will make the [shake rate=30 level=10]stupidest[/shake] decision possible in any given scenario as long as there is even a [wave amp=30 freq=10]miniscule[/wave] short-term reward.[/color]
"TOWN_HALL_CLEEO_EVENT_IANTHE5",I appreciate your honest analysis, Clee-O!
"TOWN_HALL_CLEEO_EVENT_CLEEO7",[color=#e3affe]So do I! It is my [wave amp=30 freq=10]emotions[/wave] that tell me that mankind is [shake rate=30 level=10]inherently[/shake] stupid and will eventually [shake rate=30 level=10]sow the seeds of its own destruction![/shake][/color]
"TOWN_HALL_CLEEO_EVENT_IANTHE8",Well until that happens, your services in the rangers will still be valued.
"TOWN_HALL_CLEEO_EVENT_CLEEO9",[color=#e3affe]Hmph.[/color]
"TOWN_HALL_CODEY_EVENT_CODEY1",…If I knew that people would be calling me “Codey” forever, I would have picked a cooler nickname. [pause]Like “Killswitch”, [pause]or “Omegabyte”.
"TOWN_HALL_CODEY_EVENT_IANTHE2",I mean, you can just pick your own name. I did.
"TOWN_HALL_CODEY_EVENT_CODEY3",Wait... Your name wasn’t always Ianthe?!
"TOWN_HALL_CODEY_EVENT_IANTHE4",Nope! In my former line of work, it was safer to pick an alias – I’m sure you can relate.
"TOWN_HALL_CODEY_EVENT_CODEY6",Huh. You sure do have a lot of secrets of your own, don’t you?
"TOWN_HALL_CODEY_EVENT_IANTHE7",Don’t expect me to tell you any more than that!

"TOWN_HALL_CYBIL_EVENT_CYBIL1",…And if we installed speakers throughout Harbourtown, I could broadcast music to the [wave amp=30 freq=10]entire town[/wave] at once!
"TOWN_HALL_CYBIL_EVENT_IANTHE3",I don’t know, Cybil. I suspect the folks around here have quite a diverse taste in music. I could see it being a controversial decision.
"TOWN_HALL_CYBIL_EVENT_CYBIL4",Hmm. I see your point.
"TOWN_HALL_CYBIL_EVENT_IANTHE5",Hey, I never said it was off the table entirely! [pause]I’ll tell you what: if Skip manages to dig up some intact hi-fi speakers one day, I’ll propose the idea at the following town hall meeting.
"TOWN_HALL_CYBIL_EVENT_CYBIL6",[wave amp=30 freq=10]That’s the spirit![/wave]
"TOWN_HALL_DREADFUL_EVENT_DREADFUL1",…I’m telling you boss, something’s shifted on the astral plane lately. All the ghosts are talking about it. There’s some [wave amp=30 freq=10]big players[/wave] back on the board, they’re sayin’!
"TOWN_HALL_DREADFUL_EVENT_IANTHE2",“All the ghosts”...?
"TOWN_HALL_DREADFUL_EVENT_DREADFUL3",Of course! [pause]There’s [wave amp=30 freq=10]all sorts[/wave] of spirits, shades and tulpas hanging out on the astral plane. Where do you think I get my best intel from?
"TOWN_HALL_DREADFUL_EVENT_IANTHE4",I’ll take your word for it!
"TOWN_HALL_GLADIOLA_EVENT_IANTHE1",So, what can you tell me? I want your full analysis.
"TOWN_HALL_GLADIOLA_EVENT_GLADIOLA2",Very well! [pause]Our “rogue fusion” problem has indeed been increasing in recent months. Have you seen the dense black clouds in the air, recently? I have concluded that these indicate where monsters are [wave amp=30 freq=10]swarming[/wave].
"TOWN_HALL_GLADIOLA_EVENT_GLADIOLA3",On a recent recon mission, I found myself in the midst of a swarm of Jellytons. They may have had superior numbers, but I [wave amp=30 freq=10]cut them down[/wave] all the same!
"TOWN_HALL_GLADIOLA_EVENT_GLADIOLA4",However, I fear that our more inexperienced rangers may underestimate these threats and find themselves in mortal peril. Perhaps we should get the word out about these “monster swarms”.
"TOWN_HALL_GLADIOLA_EVENT_IANTHE5",Consider it done! Your intel is as valuable as always, Gladiola.
"TOWN_HALL_GLADIOLA_EVENT_GLADIOLA6",You’re too kind! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have more work to do. The [wave amp=30 freq=10]forces of darkness[/wave] take no breaks, so neither shall I.
"TOWN_HALL_HEATHER_EVENT_HEATHER1",…Well? Do you miss it? Life in the big city, I mean.
"TOWN_HALL_HEATHER_EVENT_IANTHE3",It certainly was more [wave amp=30 freq=10]exciting[/wave]... but that doesn’t mean life was [wave amp=30 freq=10]better[/wave].
"TOWN_HALL_HEATHER_EVENT_IANTHE4",I lived my whole life in a mega-metropolis. The only trees I had seen were made in factories. The stars had long been blotted out by the skyscrapers and their neon facades.
"TOWN_HALL_HEATHER_EVENT_IANTHE6",You can imagine that when I first [wave amp=30 freq=10]landed[/wave] here, it took a long time for me to get used to this pace of life!
"TOWN_HALL_HEATHER_EVENT_HEATHER7",That’s… [pause]a bit more of an answer than I was expecting, boss!
"TOWN_HALL_JUDAS_EVENT_JUDAS1",…I’m serious, Ianthe. The latest batch of ranger trainees just don’t have what it TAKES. They don’t understand that strategy matters [wave amp=30 freq=10]more[/wave] than just transforming into the scariest monster.
"TOWN_HALL_JUDAS_EVENT_IANTHE2",Well isn’t that your job – [pause]to teach them?
"TOWN_HALL_JUDAS_EVENT_JUDAS4",Heh. I see your point. I’ll reserve my judgement…
"TOWN_HALL_JUDAS_EVENT_JUDAS5",For now.
"TOWN_HALL_LODESTEIN_EVENT_LODESTEIN1",…And that concludes my report. Our hydroelectric generators are all fully functioning. We might need some new parts in the next couple of years, but it’s small stuff.
"TOWN_HALL_LODESTEIN_EVENT_IANTHE2",Not a bad state of affairs for the town, then! Thanks for your report, Levi. 
"TOWN_HALL_LODESTEIN_EVENT_IANTHE3",It’s a miracle that we have running water and clean energy at all. I worry sometimes that things could change. This island is [wave amp=30 freq=10]unpredictable[/wave].
"TOWN_HALL_LODESTEIN_EVENT_LODESTEIN4",TOWN_HALL_LODESTEIN_EVENT_LODESTEIN4
"TOWN_HALL_LODESTEIN_EVENT_IANTHE4",Thanks for saying that – [pause]you’re right, of course!
"TOWN_HALL_SKIP_EVENT_SKIP1",…C’mon, Ianthe! You gotta tell me what your life was like before you came to New Wirral!
"TOWN_HALL_SKIP_EVENT_IANTHE2",Well… [pause]I was something like a detective, if that makes sense.
"TOWN_HALL_SKIP_EVENT_SKIP3",Wow! [pause]Did you have to find people’s missing stuff a lot? Offworlders seem to own a [wave amp=30 freq=10]lot[/wave] of things and they must lose them here and there, right?
"TOWN_HALL_SKIP_EVENT_IANTHE4",My jobs tended to be a… [pause]little higher stakes than that, if I’m honest.
"TOWN_HALL_SKIP_EVENT_SKIP5",I should better get back to my scavenging operation, but next time I see you you [wave amp=30 freq=10]have[/wave] to tell me more!
"TOWN_HALL_WALLACE_EVENT_WALLACE1",TOWN_HALL_WALLACE_EVENT_WALLACE1
"TOWN_HALL_WALLACE_EVENT_WALLACE2",Me and the boys were [wave amp=30 freq=10]proper[/wave] impressed! I was absolutely flattened in our fight.
"TOWN_HALL_WALLACE_EVENT_IANTHE3",TOWN_HALL_WALLACE_EVENT_IANTHE3
"TOWN_HALL_WALLACE_EVENT_WALLACE4",Well, it’s not often that we do combat trials for the trainees. My usual “build a brick wall” test isn’t quite as exciting to sit through…
"TOWN_HALL_WALLACE_EVENT_WALLACE5",Speaking of which, my lunch break is over! I got work to do – see you later, boss!
"TOWN_HALL_ZEDD_EVENT_ZEDD1",…I’m gonna be honest Ianthe, I don’t think the other captains [wave amp=30 freq=10]get[/wave] it.
"TOWN_HALL_ZEDD_EVENT_IANTHE2",Get… what, exactly?
"TOWN_HALL_ZEDD_EVENT_ZEDD3",The whole [wave amp=30 freq=10]sleep thing[/wave], man! My whole deal! 
"TOWN_HALL_ZEDD_EVENT_IANTHE6",Well, you [wave amp=30 freq=10]ARE[/wave] a big slacker.
"TOWN_HALL_ZEDD_EVENT_ZEDD7",Heh. I know.

"TOWN_HALL_ZEDD_EVENT_ZEDD9",TOWN_HALL_ZEDD_EVENT_ZEDD9
"TOWN_HALL_ZEDD_EVENT_ZEDD10",*Yawn* [pause]All this human interaction really takes it out of a guy. I think I’m gonna go and get some shut-eye.
"RANGER_GATEKEEPER_INTRO1",Hey! You!

"DOG_QUEST1_PART1_DOG6",[wave amp=30 freq=10]Whuhhh...[/wave]
"DOG_QUEST1_PART1_NARRATION7",Barkley’s looking up the cliff and whining. He must want to go up.
"DOG_QUEST1_PART1_NARRATION8",You can get up there with your climbing ability. Will you go with him?
"DOG_QUEST1_PART1_DOG10",Arf arf!
"DOG_QUEST1_PART1_NARRATION9",He won’t move from this spot. Perhaps if you had some way to take him up the cliff…
"DOG_QUEST1_PART2_NARRATION1",Barkley didn’t have any trouble getting up the cliff. It seems like he just wanted someone to accompany him.
"AVEREVOIR_NAME",Averevoir
"AVEREVOIR_SUBTITLE",Towering Bird
"DOG_QUEST1_PART3_DOG1",Grrrrr...
"DOG_QUEST1_PART4_NARRATION1",These look like human bones...
"DOG_QUEST1_PART4_NARRATION2",Among the bones is a dog leash and some treats.
"DOG_QUEST1_PART4_NARRATION3",Barkley digs a big hole and the pair of you bury the bones.
"DOG_QUEST1_PART4_NARRATION4",Afterwards, Barkley gives your hand a big wet lick!
"DOG_QUEST1_PART4_DOG5",*Pant pant*
"DUNGEON_MEADOW_MAD_HATTER",You’ve disturbed a monster’s tea party!
"DUNGEON_MEADOW_RED_QUEEN",Queenyx wants your head!
"END_PART1_KAYLEIGH1",Is this a coffin? {player}, why is it so big…?
"END_PART1_MEREDITH1",I don’t know what this is, but I have a hunch that we shouldn’t mess with it.
"END_PART1_EUGENE1",This is… I don’t know what to make of this.
"END_PART1_FELIX1",I’d say that this was a surprising thing to find here, but I really don’t know what I expected.
"END_PART1_VIOLA1",This coffin was assembled by mourning hands. [pause]Can you not feel it so?
"END_PART1_DOG1",[shake rate=30 level=10]Whuhhh….[/shake]

"END_PART10_MORGANTE4",FAREWELL.
"END_PART10_KAYLEIGH5",We should head back… [pause]I don’t think this train is super stable. 
"END_PART10_MEREDITH5",C’mon, let’s head back before this train falls into the abyss.
"END_PART10_EUGENE5",We should head back for now – [pause]I don’t think this train is gonna hold.
"END_PART10_FELIX5",We should probably head back before this train falls into the void, [pause]right?
"END_PART10_VIOLA5",We would be wise to return for the present.
"END_PART10_DOG5",Arf.
"END_PART11_KAYLEIGH1",Sorry your cassette player was destroyed, [pause]{player}...
"END_PART11_KAYLEIGH2",Luckily I always keep a spare on me!
"END_PART11_KAYLEIGH3",...Was this building here before?
"END_PART11_MEREDITH3",So, [pause]uh, [pause]that building wasn’t here before, was it?
"END_PART11_EUGENE3",Do you guys know what’s going on with this… [pause]building?
"END_PART11_FELIX3",Well, that’s pretty unusual.
"END_PART11_VIOLA3",How curious.
"END_PART11_BARKLEY3",Arf?
"END_PART11_AMBER4",Don’t go worryin’ about me! The name’s Ms. Amber.
"END_PART11_AMBER5",END_PART11_AMBER5
"END_PART11_AMBER6",Why, I’m just here to make sure you fine folks don’t go hurtin’ yourself.
"END_PART11_AMBER7",Though it looks like you gave our mutual friend a mighty beating already. [pause]That’s a first!
"END_PART11_AMBER7_OPTION1",Beating? I think we destroyed him.
"END_PART11_AMBER8",Folks like Aleph and I ain’t flesh and blood, sugar. [pause]It takes an idea to die for us not to be able to come back in some form.
"END_PART11_KAYLEIGH11",You’re another Archangel...
"END_PART11_AMBER12",Relax, red. I’m a friend.
"END_PART11_KAYLEIGH14",T-This really can take us back to our own worlds?
"END_PART11_KAYLEIGH15",Brilliant! [pause]I should let the rangers know before we go!

"END_PART3_ALEPH20",SPEAKING OF FRIENDS...
"END_PART3_ALEPH21",MEET THE NEW TEAM!
"END_PART3_KAYLEIGH22",Oh no...

"END_PART3_VIOLA26",I see...
"END_PART3_DOG27",Arf…?
"END_PART3_ALEPH28",Y’SEE, I USED TO BE KIND OF A BIG SHOT.
"END_PART3_ALEPH31",YOU HUMANS LIVE ON YOUR LITTLE WORLDS AND YOU INVENT ALL THESE CUTE IDEAS. LOVE, DEATH, WHATEVER… 
"END_PART3_ALEPH34B",UNFORTUNATELY MY OLD BAND GOT A TAD DYSFUNCTIONAL AND HAD TO SPLIT.
"END_PART3_ALEPH36",BUT NOW WE’RE BACK IN ACTION!
"END_PART3_KAYLEIGH37",So you and the Archangels are going to… [pause]invade worlds, and act out the violent myths that inspire your creation?
"END_PART3_MEREDITH38",That’s pretty worrying.
"END_PART3_EUGENE39",An endless cycle of violence...
"END_PART3_FELIX40",Yeah, that doesn’t sound great.
"END_PART3_VIOLA41",Such dark desires cannot be allowed to be realised!

"END_PART3_ALEPH43",HEY, DON’T WORRY ABOUT IT, FRIENDS!
"END_PART3_ALEPH46_OPTION1",A deal?
"END_PART3_ALEPH47",WE CAN ALL GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS, [pause]AND WE’LL NEVER VISIT ANY OF YOUR WORLDS. 
"END_PART3_ALEPH48_OPTION1",What?
"END_PART3_ALEPH_WHAT_49",WE’LL CONQUER OTHER PEOPLES’ WORLDS, AND LEAVE YOURS ALONE.

"END_PART3_KAYLEIGH51",All people have value, no matter what world they’re from! All we can do is do our best to help them!
"END_PART3_MEREDITH51",It would be pretty crappy of us to sell out other realities just for safe passage, [pause]mate.

"END_PART3_FELIX51",You’re gonna hurt people, even if we don’t see it happening. [pause]That’s a pretty bad deal, by my estimation.

"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX4",It’s easier to show. Check this out:
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX5",So this is a zote reel. You slot it into this zoetrope right here, then look through the slot. 
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX6",The Zoetrope has a motor in it, so when I hit this button, it spins.
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX7",The row of the zote strip has the same image drawn over and over with variations.
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX8",When spun round, it animates and comes to life, [pause]right?
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX9",Then you can pull the lever to switch to the next row, [pause]for the next part of the story.
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX10",You can tell a whole story, [pause]and bring it to life, [pause]just with drawings.
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX11",I’ve been obsessed with zotes ever since I was a kid.
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX14",Most zote stories are about heroes in the French Revolution, [pause]like the Scarlet Pimpernel, [pause]but ever since the big budget movie adaptations really took off there’s been less interest in the source material.
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX2_NO",No worries. Come say hi if you change your mind.
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX17",Right now I’m trying to come up with some new characters…
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX18",And it turns out, an island full of weird monsters is the perfect place to find inspiration!
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX19",Which means… you might be able to help me out. 
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX22_OPTION1",Sure!
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX23",Cool! I’ll mark it on your map for you.
"FELIX_INTRO2_FELIX22_NO",No worries. If your schedule frees up, swing by here and we can go on this little venture.

"FELIX_QUEST1_PART2_FELIX7",…
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART2_FELIX8",Oh [pause]no.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART2_FELIX9_OPTION1",Was that an Archangel?
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART2_FELIX10",I...
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART2_FELIX11",I think my past is coming back to haunt me.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX1",It has to be in here somewhere, [pause]I…
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX2",Found it!
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX3",Here. This is my old sketchbook from when I was 12 years old.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX6",Her name is Kuneko. 
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX7_OPTION1",Does she have angel wings?
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX8",She’s like, [pause]the daughter of an angel and a demon who was lost on earth and adopted by a mystical ninja clan....
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX9_OPTION1",That’s pretty cliche.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX10",I was going through an anime phase in middle school. [pause]Don’t judge me!
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART3_FELIX12",I have NO idea how my [wave amp=30 freq=10]low quality childhood drawing[/wave] has become real.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO1",…
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX2",Oh. [pause]That was fast.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO4",I-I have never met you, but I feel a strong connection to you…
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX5",Oh, yeah, that figures. 
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO7",I…
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO8",[shake rate=30 level=10]PLEASE FORGIVE ME![/shake]
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO10",Some time ago, I woke up in the meadow where we first met, [pause]with nothing but my name on my lips and my quest in my heart.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX12",You really don’t have to keep calling me “creator”.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO13",How about [pause]father?
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX14",That’s, [pause]uh, [pause]not much better.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO15",[pause]Master?
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX16",Nope.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO17",.[pause].[pause].[pause] Daddy?
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX18",ABSOLUTELY not.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX19",Just… [pause]call me Felix.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX19_OPTION1",Kuneko, you mentioned a quest?
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO20",I must find the four elemental shrines across this land, and defeat the beasts that guard them. 
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO21",Only THEN will I prove my strength!
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX22",Man, I really couldn’t have come up with a better storyline, could I?
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX23",Kuneko, you probably shouldn’t go on this “quest”. It’s not real... [pause]I [wave amp=30 freq=10]made it up[/wave] for your backstory.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_KUNEKO25",I know you don’t think I have what it takes, creator…
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX25",This is all… [pause]really weird. [pause]It’s not just me, [pause]right?
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX25_OPTION1",Yeah, this is pretty weird.
"FELIX_QUEST1_PART4_FELIX26",I’ve created much less embarrassing characters since I was a kid. [pause]Why HER?
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_FELIX1",I guess these altars really are real. [pause]That figures.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_FELIX2",Kuneko!
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_KUNEKO3",I must prove my strength, creator…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_KUNEKO4",By my pointy blade… [shake rate=30 level=10]show yourself, guardian![/shake]
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_FELIX5",C’mon, we should help her out.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_KUNEKO6",Thank you for your assistance, creator...
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_KUNEKO7",But I won’t need [wave amp=30 freq=10]any[/wave] help on the next battle!
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_FELIX8",She’s still committed to this, huh?
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR1_FELIX9",Alright then. [pause]Let’s find the rest.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR2_KUNEKO1",By the powers of the sun and the moon conveniently shining at the same time...
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR2_KUNEKO2",[shake rate=30 level=10]Reveal yourself, guardian![/shake]
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR2_FELIX3",She’s really getting into the role, here.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR2_KUNEKO4",To battle alongside you, creator… 
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR2_FELIX6",Honestly, it’s really no big deal…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR2_FELIX7",And… she’s gone. [pause]We should try and find the next shrine.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_FELIX1",Wait! Kuneko…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_KUNEKO2",By the power of fire and ice, [pause]making my passion for justice hot and cold at the same time…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_KUNEKO3",[shake rate=30 level=10]Unveil yourself, guardian![/shake]
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_FELIX4",Let’s move.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_KUNEKO5",You helped me again, creator…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_FELIX6",I don’t want you to hurt yourself! 
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_KUNEKO9",[pause].[pause].[pause].
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_FELIX12",I… Uh…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_KUNEKO13",I can tell by the way you look at me! 
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_FELIX16",Oh, [pause]OK, [pause]now I feel pretty bad.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_FELIX17_OPTION1",Yeah.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR3_FELIX18",I should find her and apologise.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX1",Kuneko, [pause]hey, [pause]um…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO2",The deck of cards is shuffled! I’ve drawn my final hand… [pause]Straight flush! 
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO3",[shake rate=30 level=10]Guardian, [pause]reveal yourself![/shake]
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX4",OK, [pause]let’s help and THEN I can apologise.
"FELIX_QUEST2_EPILOGUE_FELIX1",I think that whole adventure really lit a fire in me. 
"FELIX_QUEST2_EPILOGUE_FELIX5",That’s what you’re searching for, isn’t it? [pause]A way back?
"FELIX_QUEST2_EPILOGUE_FELIX5_OPTION1",Yeah!
"FELIX_QUEST2_EPILOGUE_FELIX6",A way out of here…
"FELIX_QUEST2_EPILOGUE_FELIX8",But so are your childhood characters coming to life, y’know?
"FELIX_QUEST2_EPILOGUE_FELIX10",You can count me in, no worries.
"FELIX_QUEST2_EPILOGUE_FELIX11",Oh, one more thing.
"FELIX_QUEST2_EPILOGUE_FELIX12",Here’s the sketch I told you I wanted to draw.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX5",Kuneko, I…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO6",I am just a forgotten thought, [pause]aren’t I, [pause][shake rate=30 level=10]creator?[/shake]

"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX18",I wouldn’t be the artist I am today.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO20",Y-you really mean that?
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX21",I do. [pause]Besides, you looked pretty cool to me just now.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO22",[shake rate=30 level=10]CREATOR~~
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX23",OK, OK, [pause]calm it down a bit.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO24",Sorry for trying to kill you just now, creator...
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX26",No worries! All is forgiven.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX27",Kuneko, there’s something I need to know…
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX28",How are you [wave amp=30 freq=10]real[/wave]? I don’t get it.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO29",...I do not know!
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO32",[wave amp=30 freq=10]You[/wave] are the artist, Creator Felix. [pause]You should know this more than I.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX33",...Huh. OK.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX33_OPTION1",What are you going to do now?
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO34",I don’t think I can join you both in your humble town… [pause]That is not my path.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO35",Naw, I need to become my own person! [pause]I must follow my crystal heart wherever it leads me.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_KUNEKO35_OPTION1",I wish you well!
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX36",Well if this is where our paths diverge....
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX37",I’m thankful that I met you, Kuneko!

"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX42",…[pause]She really needs to work on her dramatic metaphors.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX43",Well. This has been an interesting experience.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX44",And I’m not just talking about us [wave amp=30 freq=10]combining[/wave] into one big monster. That was, um, new.
"FELIX_QUEST2_ALTAR4_FELIX44_OPTION1",We prefer the term “fusion”.

"INTERMISSION_PART1_ALEPH2",SORRY, [pause]IS THIS TOO LOUD?
"INTERMISSION_PART1_ALEPH3",MAYBE THIS IS A LITTLE EASIER FOR YOU.
"INTERMISSION_PART1_KAYLEIGH5",The triangle man! Who are you, and what do you want?
"INTERMISSION_PART1_MEREDITH5",Is this the same bloke who keeps appearing in the stations? [pause]Who are you, anyway?
"INTERMISSION_PART1_EUGENE5",You don’t scare me! Who are you?!

"INTERMISSION_PART1_ALEPH6_OPTION1",Are you an Archangel?
"INTERMISSION_PART1_ALEPH7",ARCHANGEL! [pause]IS THAT WHAT YOU CALL US? HOW DELIGHTFUL!
"INTERMISSION_PART1_ALEPH11",ALAS, [pause][pause]I AM ALEPH.
"INTERMISSION_PART1_KAYLEIGH13",He sure is… [pause]polite.
"INTERMISSION_PART1_MEREDITH13",He’s, uh, not what I expected.
"INTERMISSION_PART1_EUGENE13",What’s with his “nice guy” act?
"INTERMISSION_PART1_FELIX13",Nice to… meet you…?
"INTERMISSION_PART1_VIOLA13",You want something from us – [pause]speak plainly!

"INTERMISSION_PART1_FELIX24",Uh… {player}..?
"INTERMISSION_PART1_VIOLA24",What manner of a man is he...?

"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER1",A simpler time. 
"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER1_OPTION1",Do you know Aleph?
"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER2",He and I were like family once, [pause]back in the good old days.
"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER3",There was a whole gang of us, [pause]and we had some mighty fine times together, [pause]let me tell you.
"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER6",But sometimes folks just grow apart. Sometimes it gets messy at the end.
"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER8",I’m sure Aleph’s still tryin’ to find his ticket off that island, [pause]even now. 
"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER10",But I don’t want to bore you with this old girl’s tales of days gone by.

"INTERMISSION_PART4_AMBER13",I’m just the face of the establishment.

"INTERMISSION_PART6_MEREDITH3_OPTION1",Yep.
"INTERMISSION_PART6_VIOLA4",Nothing about this “Aleph” is trustworthy. We best be on guard if he shows his sharply-angled face again.
"INTERMISSION_PART6_EUGENE5",We don’t know what this guy is planning, do we? It sounds like he has an [shake rate=30 level=10]agenda[/shake] alright – one that involves finding other Archangels.
"INTERMISSION_PART6_KAYLEIGH5",We still don’t know what Aleph is up to, though. We only know that he’s interested in the [wave amp=30 freq=10]other[/wave] Archangels.
"INTERMISSION_PART6_FELIX6",I guess my question is: what do you wanna do about this guy? He’s clearly up to something, but all this stuff [wave amp=30 freq=10]might[/wave] be a bit above our paygrade.
"INTERMISSION_PART6_MEREDITH6",OK, so what do we do about this bloke? Like, [pause]he’s up to something, [pause]but he’s an [wave amp=30 freq=10]Archangel[/wave]. I feel like Archangel stuff is out of our league.
"INTERMISSION_PART6_KAYLEIGH6",Well, {player}? What do you think we should do about him? Aleph has already shown that he’s willing to [wave amp=30 freq=10]remove[/wave] anyone he sees as being in his way, but… [pause]I think all this might be out of our league. 
"INTERMISSION_PART6_FELIX6_OPTION1",We keep an eye on him.
"INTERMISSION_PART6_KAYLEIGH7",Right! Good plan.

"INTRO_KAYLEIGH4",OK, quick question: [pause]what’s your... [pause]aesthetic?
"INTRO_KAYLEIGH5",Yeah, I can see that! In that case, take this.

"INTRO_PENSBY24",I don’t think it’s anything serious. Transforming for the first time is quite a shock to the psyche.
"INTRO_KAYLEIGH25",Anyway, Harbourtown happened to have a spare home available for you, so this is your place now!

"TUTORIAL1_PART1_KAYLEIGH8",There was some kind of quake or monster activity last night – You can see the cracks in the ground.

"TUTORIAL1_PART2_KAYLEIGH2",You’ll adjust in no time – [pause]It’s like riding a bike!
"TUTORIAL1_PART2_KAYLEIGH3",Except, [pause]y’know, [pause]if the bike transformed into {first_tape_description}...
"TUTORIAL1_PART2_KAYLEIGH5",You see that creep with the boots? It’s a Springheel – and it’s gonna get aggressive with you if you get any closer.

"TUTORIAL1_PART2_KAYLEIGH8",The green bar represents your monster form’s health, and the red is yours.

"TUTORIAL2_PART3_KAYLEIGH8",Now, let’s finish this bug off!
"TUTORIAL2_PART3_KAYLEIGH1",OK, take these!
"TUTORIAL2_PART3_KAYLEIGH2",There’s something about the monsters on New Wirral…
"TUTORIAL2_PART3_KAYLEIGH3",When weakened, their essence can be,[pause] well,[pause] recorded to cassette tapes.
"TUTORIAL2_PART3_KAYLEIGH5",Now try switching to the tape you just recorded!
"TUTORIAL2_PART4_PLAYER1",Is this meant to happen?!
"TUTORIAL2_PART4_KAYLEIGH1",Some monster forms give us…. extra abilities when we record them, beyond just being able to take their shapes. 
"TUTORIAL2_PART4_KAYLEIGH3",Sorry, I should probably have warned you, but I thought it might be a little easier to show you. 
"TUTORIAL2_PART4_KAYLEIGH4",We can use this glide to get across that gap right there.
"TUTORIAL3_PART1_KAYLEIGH1",What’s going on? If this is because of monster activity, we better stay sharp.
"TUTORIAL3_PART2_KAYLEIGH1",OK, you felt that one, right?
"TUTORIAL3_PART2_KAYLEIGH2",What is that?!
"TUTORIAL3_PART2_KAYLEIGH3_OPTION1",Isn’t this part of Harbourtown?
"TUTORIAL3_PART2_KAYLEIGH4",I’ve never seen ANYTHING like this before! 
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH1",This place smells like… Burning metal. I can’t explain it…
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH2",{player}, can you feel something in the air..?
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE1",IS THAT YOU, MORDREAD?

COME CLOSER, CHILD... SO THAT I MAY SEE YOU ONE LAST TIME.
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH3",[shake rate=30 level=10]This is… This is…[/shake]
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE2",THE LONG CONFLICT HAS DRAWN TO AN END… I AM AFRAID HE HAS DEFEATED ME TRULY THIS TIME.
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH4",{player}, I think this is an [shake rate=30 level=10]Archangel[/shake]…
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_PLAYER1_OPTION1",Who are you?
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE3",NO, NO, YOU ARE NOT MY KIN.

YOU COME FOR ME ONCE AGAIN, SWORD IN HAND?!
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH6",Oh no…
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE12",ENOUGH. MY TIME IS DRAWING TO AN END.

WHY HAVE YOU COME TO THIS WRETCHED PLACE?
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE12_OPTION1",I want to go home!
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE13",I SEE.

THERE IS A WAY. THERE ARE NONE WHO KNOW THE PATH BUT I.
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE14",I REQUIRE A VESSEL AND YOU REQUIRE A GUIDE.

REBUILD MY STRENGTH AND IN TURN I SHALL LEAD YOU FROM THIS LAND.
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE14_OPTION1",Vessel...?
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_MORGANTE15",VERY WELL. HEAR MY SONG.
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH16",{player}, are you OK?! [pause]What happened?! [pause]You blanked out for a second there!
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH11",How... [pause]did we…
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH11_OPTION1",I don’t know…
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH7",I am not gonna die here, not like this.
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH9",I refuse!
"HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH10",HARBOURTOWN_STATION_KAYLEIGH10
"TUTORIAL4_PART3A_KAYLEIGH1",A [wave amp=30 freq=10]lot[/wave] happened at that train station… I guess we should probably talk about it.
"TUTORIAL4_PART3A_KAYLEIGH1_OPTION1",About the “Archangel”...
"TUTORIAL4_PART3B_KAYLEIGH6",Archangels…
"TUTORIAL4_PART3B_KAYLEIGH7",Supposedly, when the first unlucky sods washed up on the shores of New Wirral, they thought the monsters here were angels.
"TUTORIAL4_PART3B_KAYLEIGH11",They’ve had a bunch of names over the years – angels, demons, devils, ghouls…
"TUTORIAL4_PART3B_KAYLEIGH13",Those other creatures, though… [pause]Like the one we fought... [pause]They’re still Archangels to us. 
"TUTORIAL4_PART3B_KAYLEIGH17",Oh! Sorry, [pause]I’m making some assumptions there!
"TUTORIAL4_PART3B_KAYLEIGH19",You might not know what movies are!
"TUTORIAL4_PART3B_KAYLEIGH19_OPTION1",I do!
"TUTORIAL4_PART3B_KAYLEIGH20",Phew, [pause]OK, [pause]grand! I’ve been in New Wirral for three years and I’ve still not completely learned to adjust my... [pause]cultural references when I talk to new folks. 
"TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH1",Oh. [pause]Yeah. [pause][wave amp=30 freq=10]That.[/wave]
"TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH2",“Fusion” is a rare phenomenon known by the rangers. There are fused monsters in the wild, and supposedly the leader of the rangers can do it too.
"TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH6",I-[pause]I’ve never fused with anyone before. I certainly wasn’t expecting to fuse with someone I [wave amp=30 freq=10]barely[/wave] know…
"TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH8",Sorry, [pause]talking about it is a little awkward!
"TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH8_OPTION1",TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH8_OPTION1
"TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH9",Y-yeah, I guess you’re right!
"TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH10",Now that we’ve done it, I have this weird feeling inside me. Like… a door has been opened that I didn’t even know was there before.
"TUTORIAL4_PART3C_KAYLEIGH11",I feel like I’d be able to fuse with you again, if we ever needed to.
"TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH1",So let me get this straight…
"TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH22",If there is even a chance that this can lead to a way off this island and return people to their homes and their families…
"TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH24",You and I!
"TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH25",What do you say? Are we in this together?
"TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH25_OPTION1",Let’s do this!
"TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH26",If an Archangel gave you that vision, then...
"TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH28",TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH28
"TUTORIAL4_PART3D_KAYLEIGH29",She’ll be at the outpost in the park right about now.
"COMMUNE_CULTIST_1_POST_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH1",I don’t even remember this man, but he seems to remember me…
"COMMUNE_CULTIST_2_POST_BATTLE_KAYLEIGH",What is Dorian up to? I’m worried…
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH1",I need to tell you some stuff.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH2",A-and, you’ll probably think worse of me when I’m finished. Sorry.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH3",You see, when I first came to New Wirral, I didn’t live in Harbourtown.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH6_OPTION1",Yep!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH7",That’s them. And I guess… [pause]I was one of them once. 
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH10",Mourningtown was founded with the intent of helping everyone, [pause]but it soon just became about what [wave amp=30 freq=30]he[/wave] wanted.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH16_OPTION1",Of course!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH17A",That’s the spirit! I hope some good can come out of all this.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH17B",I am. I know it’ll be hard, but… I want some good to come out of everything I went through.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH18",OK, [pause]right, [pause]I’ll mark the entrance to the commune on your map.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART2_KAYLEIGH1",Greetings. I am here to speak to Dorian.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART2_DOORMAN2",Miss Kayleigh.... Welcome back!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART2_DOORMAN1",KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART2_DOORMAN1
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST1_PART3_KAYLEIGH1",“Just in time”? In time for what?
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART1_KAYLEIGH1",It feels weird being back here...
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_JACQUELINE1",May we have quiet in the audience!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_KAYLEIGH2",Who is she? Is she… my replacement? Creepy.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_JACQUELINE3",Dorian will now speak!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN4",[pause].[pause].[pause].
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN5",[wave amp=30 freq=10]HOW’S IT GOIN’, EVERYBODY![/wave]
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN6",Man, what a great crowd you always are!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN9",This pit is as [wave amp=30 freq=10]deep[/wave] as your devotion to the cause. [pause]It’s like a [wave amp=30 freq=10]metaphor[/wave]!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN12",But we’ve done it! [pause]Pull the curtain!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN13",[shake rate=30 level=10]THE SERPENT GOD AWAITS US, BABY![/shake]
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN14",Soon I will enter the chamber and bargain with him for a share of his [wave amp=30 freq=10]divine power![/wave]
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN16",Isn’t that right… [wave amp=30 freq=10]Kayleigh[/wave]?
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_KAYLEIGH17",Oh no.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN18",Kayleigh, [pause]honey, [pause]you look like a deer in the headlights! [pause]Of course I got word you were joining us for our big party!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_KAYLEIGH20",{player}...
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_KAYLEIGH21",I’m sorry...
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN23",You didn’t believe in me, did you? Well it looks like I was [wave amp=30 freq=10]right all along, baby![/wave]
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_KAYLEIGH25",We’ve [wave amp=30 freq=10]fought[/wave] Archangels, Dorian! 
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN27",KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN27
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN29",Jacqueline – the platform, if you please.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_JACQUELINE30",As you wish, sir.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_DORIAN31",[wave amp=30 freq=10]See you inside[/wave], Kayleigh!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART2_KAYLEIGH32",I hate him so much.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART3_DORIAN1",KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART3_DORIAN1
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART3_JACQUELINE3",Sir…?
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART3_DORIAN4",KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART3_DORIAN4
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART3_KAYLEIGH5",You’re a fool and you’re going to get yourself killed.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART3_DORIAN6",You [wave amp=30 freq=10]first[/wave].
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_MOURNINGSTAR1",HAVE YOU HEARD MY CALL?

ARE YOU HERE TO PAY TRIBUTE?

ARE YOU HERE TO BURN FOR ME?
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_MOURNINGSTAR6",YOU DO NOT TAKE FROM ME. YOU ONLY GIVE.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_KAYLEIGH7",[wave amp=30 rate=10]I told him this would happen![/wave]
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_ALEPH9",MOURNINGSTAR, IS THAT RIGHT?
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_ALEPH10",BOY DO I HAVE A JOB OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_KAYLEIGH11",...
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_JACQUELINE12",Dorian…
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_KAYLEIGH13",I’m sorry, [pause]but it’s his own fault.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_DORIAN2",Here goes nothing…
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_DORIAN3",[wave amp=30 rate=10]O GREAT ARCHANGEL![/wave]
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART4_DORIAN5",[wave amp=30 rate=10]FOR MY LOYALTY, I ASK ONLY FOR A SHARE OF YOUR DIVINE STRENGTH![/wave]
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_JACQUELINE1",The commune...
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_JACQUELINE3",We only wanted guidance… [pause]We [pause]never…
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_KAYLEIGH4",I know.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_KAYLEIGH7",That was messed up…
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_KAYLEIGH7_OPTION1",Are you OK?
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_KAYLEIGH8",I’m… [pause][pause][pause]I’ll be fine.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_KAYLEIGH16",I felt for so long like I was doing good – [pause]helping to maintain a positive status quo, even if people would get hurt now and then.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_KAYLEIGH17_OPTION1",I don’t believe that!
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_KAYLEIGH18",Heh… I’m glad you believe that.
"KAYLEIGH_QUEST2_PART5_KAYLEIGH19",I hope they all do better with him gone now. 
"REGION_NAME_CAFE",Gramophone Café
"CLEMENCE_METAL_TAPES1",{player}! I have something for you.
"CLEMENCE_METAL_TAPES2",Ranger Wilma came from the Town Hall to provide my establishment with new stock.
"CLEMENCE_INTRO1",CLEMENCE_INTRO1
"CLEMENCE_INTRO2",I am Clémence, and this fine establishment is the Gramophone Café. What can I say? I own many records, and I brew the best coffee. Not that there is much competition.
"CLEMENCE_INTRO3",Please, feel free to ask me any questions. I am in no rush.
"CLEMENCE_MENU_DIALOGUE",Bonjour! What can I do for you?
"MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY_CLEMENCE1",Do I have this record..? 
"MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY_CLEMENCE2",No. You can ask the Rangers at the Town Hall.
"CLEMENCE_BYE",Au revoir!
"CLEMENCE_CAFE1",Oui. When I arrived in Harbourtown, the people here were crying out for a place to socialise, a place that must be stylish. I made that place – if not me, who else?
"CLEMENCE_CAFE2",The town had a Gramophone, an old machine for playing musical records. So I took this machine and I made it the centerpiece of this new establishment. But the people, they cried out to me, “Clémence! You have a Gramophone but no music!”
"CLEMENCE_CAFE3",Well, one day the rangers find a place, it is filled with intact records. So they bring them to me. They lamented, “we have the records, but they are made for modern record players – our Gramophone cannot play them!”
"CLEMENCE_CAFE4",I said to them, “shush!” And I fixed the Gramophone and now we can play the records. Now my café is stylish, and it has music. Everyone is happy. The end.
"CLEMENCE_ARRIVAL1",I fell. [pause]Landed in the ocean. [pause]Washed up here.[pause] About ten years ago now. It is what it is.
"CLEMENCE_ARRIVAL2",I miss…
"CLEMENCE_ARRIVAL3",Motorbikes.
"CLEMENCE_COFFEE1",I have a… Special method. And the Pipers grow me coffee beans on their farm. 
"CLEMENCE_COFFEE2",It is a good arrangement, oui?
"REGION_NAME_HOSPITAL",Harbourtown Hospital
"PENSBY_INTERACT_MENU",Hey {player}, what can I do for you?
"PENSBY_INTERACT_MENU_SUPPLIES",I’m looking for supplies.
"PENSBY_INTERACT_BYE",Try not to get yourself hurt too badly out there, OK?
"PENSBY_INTERACT_CHECKUP_HURT1",Let me take a look at you…
"PENSBY_INTERACT_CHECKUP_HURT2",It’s just a few bumps and scratches. Nothing serious.
"PENSBY_INTERACT_CHECKUP_HURT3",I’m going to prescribe you some rest.[pause] Why don’t you head over to the Gramophone café and take it easy for a bit?
"PENSBY_INTERACT_CHECKUP_HEALTHY1",You’re in perfect health, {player}.

"RANGER_TRADER_OPTION1",What have you got?
"RANGER_TRADER_FUSED_MATERIAL1",Fused Material? I don’t really know what it is, but for some reason Ianthe seems to think we need to collect a lot of it.
"RANGER_TRADER_BYE",Ta-ta for now!
"RANGER_VENDING_MACHINE_NAME",Vending Machine
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_POST_BATTLE_ALEPH2",NICE PLACE YOU HAVE HERE, PAL.
"MEREDITH_INTRO_MEREDITH1",MEREDITH_INTRO_MEREDITH1
"MEREDITH_INTRO_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",Have we met?
"MEREDITH_INTRO_MEREDITH2",Hoylake was babbling on about you when he came by to pick up some parts from my shop.
"MEREDITH_INTRO_MEREDITH4",Did you know he’s not even a real scientist? [pause]Before he landed on New Wirral, he was a DATA ANALYST. 
"MEREDITH_INTRO_MEREDITH6",MEREDITH_INTRO_MEREDITH6
"MEREDITH_INTRO_MEREDITH6_OPTION1",I’m going to find a way out!
"MEREDITH_INTRO_A_MEREDITH1",MEREDITH_INTRO_A_MEREDITH1
"MEREDITH_INTRO_B_MEREDITH1",There’s like, what, a couple hundred people here max? 
"MEREDITH_INTRO_END_MEREDITH1",Anyway, I just needed a breath of fresh air. Come meet me at my shop in town sometime. Yellow building on the boardwalk.
"MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY_IANTHE1",Meredith is looking for a music record? [pause]You must know your chances of finding this particular record are pretty close to zero, right?
"MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY_IANTHE3_OPTION1",Falldown Mall?
"MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY_IANTHE4",MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY_IANTHE4
"MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY_IANTHE7",There’s a music shop in the mall, filled with records and cassette tapes, but we keep it locked up for security. 
"MEREDITH_QUEST1_QUERY_IANTHE9",If the record is there, Meredith might be risking her life just to get it. [pause]The rational part of me wants to formally forbid her from trying...
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH12",MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH12
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH12_OPTION1",I’m still looking for your record!
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH13A",Oh, cool. It’s kind of a long shot, y’know. The math isn’t in my favour on this one. I appreciate it anyway.
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH13B",Yeah, get used to that. Time doesn’t exactly fly by here. We’re a bit short on entertainment.
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH1",Oh. You again. I had something to ask you…
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH2_OPTION1",Yeah!
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH3",Huh. I almost admire your optimism.
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_NO_MEREDITH2",Oh hey. It’s you.
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH4_OPTION1",Sure! What are you looking for?
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH5",It’s a, um, music record. [pause]Do you know what that is?
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH5_OPTION1",Yeah!
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_MEREDITH6",OK, cool. 
"MEREDITH_INTRO2_NO_MEREDITH1",Sure. You’ve got stuff to do I’m sure. So have I.
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH1",What’s this? A letter..?
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH2",Oh.
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH2_OPTION1",What did it say?
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH3",It’s a note from Ianthe. She says my record might be at Falldown Mall, and I have permission to go…
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH5",Well, shall we go, then?
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH5_OPTION1",Are you sure?
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH6",Don’t worry, I can defend myself – you didn’t think I wouldn’t have my own cassette player, did you?
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH7",Sitting around here all day is killing me. [pause]Finding that album is just something to strive for, I guess. 
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH9",Do you… [pause]Do you know what’s driving you right now?
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH9_OPTION1",I want to find a way back home.
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH10",Like I said to you before, that’s impossible.
"MEREDITH_QUEST3_MEREDITH13",Why not, right? I’ll need something new to strive for, after all.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART1_MEREDITH1",If I’m being honest? I bet this place looked way tackier before all the… [pause]Structural decay. 
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART1_MEREDITH2",I admire the “post-apocalypse” chic. 
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART1_MEREDITH3",That shop up there looks like the kind of place you’d find music, right?
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART2_MEREDITH1",“Vinyl Beat”. I guess this is the place. Should we go inside?
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART2_MEREDITH1_OPTION1",Sure!
"PLATFORM_DIALOG_REQUIRE_2_TAPES",This could be dangerous. You should have at least 2 working tapes with you before continuing.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART4_DESCRIPTION",This record has “The Witch House” written on it in big red letters.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART4_MEREDITH1B",That album art – I’ve found it!
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART4_MEREDITH1A",That album art – you’ve found it!
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART4_MEREDITH2",Wait. [pause][pause]Something’s not right.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART4_MEREDITH7",It’s some [wave amp=30 freq=30]alternate universe[/wave] version. [pause]The one I wanted isn’t here.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART4_MEREDITH8",I knew I shouldn’t have expected anything good to happen to me.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART4_MEREDITH9",Typical...
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MEREDITH1",Urgh, what happened…
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MEREDITH3",The record – I dropped it. Can you see it?
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH1A",We did it… [pause]We’re alive… [pause]We [pause]fused..?
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH1B",We did it… [pause]We’re alive…
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_FUSE_MEREDITH1",It’d be so easy...
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_FUSE_MEREDITH2",It’d be so easy to give up and just die…
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_FUSE_MEREDITH3",But that’s not me! I’m sick of letting myself down!
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH4",Uh...
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH7",MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH7
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_POST_BATTLE_MEREDITH9",C’mon, let’s go back to town and check this record out. 
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH1",So… The whole… Fusion thing....
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH2_OPTION1",It’s pretty weird, right?
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH3",It’s certainly… [pause]Something. 
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH7",MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH7
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH8",N-[pause]not that it’s a big deal if you have! [pause]I just wasn’t sure if that was your first time.
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH10",Forget I said anything.
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH11",I’ve been meaning to ask… 
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH12_OPTION1",I had a vision…
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH13",Uh, you’re gonna have to tell me the full story here, mate.
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH14",…Huh. That’s pretty wild.
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH15",I’ll uphold my end of the bargain. You helped me find a record, I’ll help you find a way off New Wirral.
"MEREDITH_QUEST5_PART6A_MEREDITH16",Oh! I almost forgot about the record!
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART6B_MEREDITH1",...
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART6B_MEREDITH2",This is pretty good. 
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART6B_MEREDITH5",When I went to college, I wanted to change, for real.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART6B_MEREDITH9",Maybe that’s what that Archangel meant. Maybe I’ve spent too much time distracting myself with stuff instead of trying to actually live.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART6B_MEREDITH11",You didn’t need to risk your life to help me.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART6B_MEREDITH13",You’re kinda cool.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PASSIVE1_MEREDITH",This would be a great place to film a movie. Maybe the monsters could be extras?
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PASSIVE2_MEREDITH",This place must have looked so different filled with people...
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PASSIVE3_MEREDITH",I really hope that was water I just stepped in.
"PYLON_HINT_MEREDITH1",PYLON_HINT_MEREDITH1
"PYLON_HINT_MEREDITH2",Do you see that blue box up there? [pause]I’ve seen them all over the island. They emit a constant magnetic pull.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MONARCH4",I KNEW I FELT IT!

AN EMPTINESS. A HOLE WHERE A HEART SHOULD BE. IT EMPOWERS ME.

I WISH TO CONSUME IT WHOLE.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MEREDITH5",W-who are you? [pause]What are you talking about?
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MONARCH6",YOUR KIND COULD LIVE SUCH RICH LIVES.

BUT INSTEAD YOU TRADE IT FOR HOLLOW SYMBOLS AND ARTIFICE.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MEREDITH8",Your… [pause]castle? [pause]The mall? [pause]Are you serious?
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MEREDITH9",This place is a ruin! Filled with trash!
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MEREDITH10",[shake rate=30 level=10]It’s nothing![/shake]
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART5_MONARCH11",YES… IT IS NOTHING...

AND I AM THE KING OF NOTHING!

COME, LET ME CONSUME YOUR EMPTINESS!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_D1_EUGENE1",...So you’re a dog.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_D1_DOG2",Arf!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_D1_EUGENE3",…But you can use a cassette player to transform into monsters like the rest of us.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_D1_DOG4",Arf arf!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_D1_EUGENE5",Are you some kind of… [pause]magical talking dog? [pause]From another world?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_D1_DOG6",Arf!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_D1_EUGENE7",Hmm. [pause]I guess not.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_F1_EUGENE1",...So you quit your job, [pause]because your bosses kept screwing you around?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_F1_FELIX2",Pretty much. [pause]It’s more than that, [pause]though. [pause]If I went to work somewhere else, I’d just have [wave amp=30 freq=10]another[/wave] boss giving me orders.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_F1_EUGENE4",[shake rate=30 level=10]Yeah![/shake] [pause]That’s the spirit! [pause]No more bosses – live on your own terms, [pause]man!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_F1_FELIX5",Though my career plans have hit a roadblock recently. [pause][pause]I think it happened after I fell through time and space and ended up living on monster island.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_F1_EUGENE6",It happens to the best of us!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_V1_EUGENE1",...So you washed up on New Wirral after being shipwrecked in a storm, [pause]right?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_V1_VIOLA2",Yes, [pause]that is correct.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_V1_EUGENE3",And you’re looking for your twin brother, Sebastian…
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_V1_VIOLA5",I can assure you that I am no-one of notoriety or interest. [pause]As for whether we’ve met? [pause]I’m sure I would remember someone as spirited as thee, [pause]Eugene.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_E_V1_EUGENE6",I guess so. [pause]Still, [pause]your story seems so familiar…
"PARTNER_INTERACT_F_D1_FELIX1",You pack a loud bark for such a small package, [pause]don’t you?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_F_D1_DOG2",Arf!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_F_V1_VIOLA1",Surely, [pause]Felix, [pause]you have longed for freedom upon the seas? [pause]To sail to lands that are not yet even a splinter upon the horizon?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_F_V1_FELIX2",Well, finding freedom in my life is important to me, [pause]but sailing the seven seas isn’t entirely what I have in mind.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_F_V1_FELIX3",Working for myself and living on my own terms, [pause]though? [pause]That sounds pretty good to me.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_F_V1_VIOLA4",Perhaps you would also find fulfilment on the sea. [pause]You will never truly know for sure without setting sail!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_F_V1_FELIX5",I suppose not!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_D1_KAYLEIGH1",[wave amp=30 freq=10]Who’s a good boy? You are! Yes, you![/wave]
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_D1_DOG2",Arf arf!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_E1_KAYLEIGH1",...I don’t understand you, Eugene. [pause]You love all this “save the community” stuff, [pause]but you don’t want to join the rangers with me?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_E1_EUGENE2",It’s nothing personal. [pause]I’m just a loose cannon, is all. [pause]A lone wolf. [pause]I can’t abide by an organisation that might hold me back.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_E1_KAYLEIGH3",I don’t think that’s it. [pause]I think you’re scared that you might fail the entry test!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_E1_EUGENE4",[shake rate=30 level=10]Th-that’s not it at all![/shake]
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_F1_KAYLEIGH1",Hey, [pause]I have a question for you, Felix! I know you draw cartoons, but do you also design tattoos?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_F1_FELIX2",I can’t say I have! [pause]Are you looking to get inked?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_F1_KAYLEIGH3",Hmm. [pause]I think I like the idea of getting a tattoo in theory.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_M1_MEREDITH1",...I really don’t get it.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_M1_KAYLEIGH3",Y’know, [pause]the internet? [pause]Like on computers, or phones?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_M1_MEREDITH4",On phones? [pause]Do you speak to people over it?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_M1_KAYLEIGH5",…What was the current year in your world before you came here, [pause]Meredith?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_M1_MEREDITH6",1989, why do you ask?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_M1_KAYLEIGH7",Oh! [pause]OK. I can see we’re maybe a little out of sync with each other.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_V1_KAYLEIGH1",Viola, I gotta ask…
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_V1_KAYLEIGH2",Where did you get that sleeveless jacket? [pause]I’ve never seen anything like it in New Wirral before!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_V1_VIOLA3",When I washed up on the sands of this lonely isle, [pause]I found an old soldier’s jacket cast aside on the beach.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_V1_KAYLEIGH6",You’re so cool... I’m definitely crushing on you a little bit right now.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_V1_VIOLA7",Are you confessing your unending love for me, [pause]dear Kayleigh?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_K_V1_KAYLEIGH8",Hey, [pause]I’m not THAT easily won over!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_D1_DOG1",Arf!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_D1_MEREDITH2",You like belly rubs, [pause]don’t you?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_MEREDITH1",...I did have some engineering work to do back at the shop, [pause]but I might just swerve it for now.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_EUGENE2",Yeah! [pause]You gotta take a break sometimes, [pause]buddy!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_EUGENE3",….[pause][pause]Wait, [pause]what did you say just now?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_MEREDITH4",Uhh, [pause]I said I had some engineering work to do?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_EUGENE5",What did you say [wave amp=30 freq=10]after[/wave] that…?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_MEREDITH6",...I was gonna swerve it?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_EUGENE7",Is that a phrase? [pause]To “swerve” something?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_MEREDITH8",Oh, [pause]I mean, [pause]yeah. [pause]Like if you’re going to skip out on doing something or going somewhere, that’s you “swerving” it.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_EUGENE9",OK, gotcha. [pause]I shall embrace your unusual slang with an open mind.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_E1_MEREDITH10",I think I’m gonna swerve this whole conversation.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_F1_MEREDITH1",...My music tastes?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_F1_FELIX2",Yeah! [pause]What did you used to listen to back in your world?
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_F1_MEREDITH3",That’s a broad question. [pause]I like bands where all the members hate each other.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_F1_FELIX4",That’s very specific.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_F1_MEREDITH5",I’m a very specific person.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_V1_VIOLA1",I must confess, [pause]dear Meredith, [pause]the way in which you fashion yourself is unlike any I have seen before – [pause]in my country, and in this one.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_V1_MEREDITH2",I’m not sure if that’s a compliment or not.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_V1_VIOLA3",I mean no insult. [pause]You seem unconcerned with aligning yourself with the appearance of those around you. [pause]It implies a deeper confidence in oneself.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_V1_VIOLA4",I find you rather admirable in that regard, [pause]dear Meredith!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_M_V1_MEREDITH5",Uh, [pause]thanks mate.
"PARTNER_INTERACT_V_D1_VIOLA1",What a brave new world, [pause]to have such animals such as you in it!
"PARTNER_INTERACT_V_D1_DOG2",Arf!

"MISS_MIMIC_CHEST_MEREDITH2",Uh, this chest talks?
"MISS_MIMIC_CHEST_EUGENE1",A talking locker!
"MISS_MIMIC_CHEST_FELIX1",I’ve got a bad feeling about this...
"MISS_MIMIC_CHEST_VIOLA1",Another contrivance from your world, {player}?
"MISS_MIMIC_CHEST_DOG1",Grr...
"MISS_MIMIC_CHEST_CONFIRM",Open the cache?
"TUTORIAL_BOSS_1",TUTORIAL_BOSS_1
"TUTORIAL_BOSS_2",If you need to heal up, check your inventory (press {control.pause_menu}) for some cake.
"TUTORIAL_BOSS_3",Or we can glide back down to the tent near the start to rest if you like.
"TUTORIAL_BOSS_4",If we get caught in a tight spot, check the Battle Items tab in your inventory.
"TUTORIAL_BOSS_5",Are you feeling up to it?
"TUTORIAL_CLIFFS_1",We'll need to get up this cliff. Just jumping ({control.jump}) won't help in this case.
"TUTORIAL_CLIFFS_2",OK, let's get creative! There are a few ways we could get up there.
"TUTORIAL_CLIFFS_3",For starters, you could try looking for something you can pick up and put down here to give us a boost.
"TUTORIAL_CLIFFS_4",Or... Do you see that pylon? You can use your magnetism ability (hold {control.magnetism}) here to levitate.
"TUTORIAL_CLIFFS_5",You can also shoot vines, right? If you face the cliff and press {control.interact}, you can use a vine to climb up it!
"TUTORIAL_CLIFFS_6",What's your preference?
"TUTORIAL_GLIDE_3",Come on, it's not far now!
"TUTORIAL_GLIDE_1",Follow me, {player}. Don't be scared!
"TUTORIAL_GLIDE_2",It's easy! When you jump off, just keep {control.jump} held down and you won't fall!
"TUTORIAL_INTRO_1",Hi {player}, glad you could make it!
Press {control.ui_accept} to continue.
"TUTORIAL_INTRO_2",I need your help dealing with a rogue fusion. Feeling up to it?
"TUTORIAL_INTRO_3",Let's get moving then! There are some cliffs up ahead. Lead the way with {control.move_up} {control.move_left} {control.move_down} {control.move_right}.

"FARM_INTRO_EDWARD2",Well, that bridge just over there connects us here on the farm to Harbourtown. [pause]We provide most of the fresh produce that the town consumes.
"FARM_EDWARD_INTERACT1",If this bridge problem persists, Harbourtown’s food supply might start to run low…
"FRANKIE_PART1_CYBIL1",[wave amp=30 freq=10]Hey-hey[/wave], {player}! [pause]I want you to meet our latest and greatest recruit: Frankie!

"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE2_OPTION1",FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE2_OPTION1
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE3",A magical world full of monsters, and the dashing heroes who transform to battle them…
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE4",[shake rate=30 level=10]THIS IS EVERYTHING I EVER DREAMED OF![/shake] 
"FRANKIE_PART1_KAYLEIGH5",You’re pretty excited by all this, aren’t you?
"FRANKIE_PART1_MEREDITH5",That’s not the reaction I was expecting.
"FRANKIE_PART1_EUGENE5",I like your enthusiasm!
"FRANKIE_PART1_FELIX5",You’re more enthusiastic than I was when I first came here.
"FRANKIE_PART1_VIOLA5",You don’t seem disturbed by your unexpected voyage to this place, friend.
"FRANKIE_PART1_CYBIL6",As you can see, Frankie here has taken the news of coming to New Wirral pretty well.
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE7",I assure you, I want to make the most of this! Joining the Rangers is no doubt the path this adventure has in store for me! Hehe~
"FRANKIE_PART1_CYBIL8",I’ve given Frankie a spare cassette player. All you’ll need to do now is give her a monster tape, and show her the ropes!
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE10",My very own monster form… The first step on my own fantastical journey...
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE11_OPTION1",Here it is!
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE11_OPTION2",Not yet.
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE12",I’m gonna be {species_description}, huh?
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE14",[shake rate=30 level=10]THIS FORM IS PERFECT! I WILL TREASURE THIS CASSETTE TAPE WITH MY LIFE![/shake]
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE16",Wow, turning into a weird monster is actually much more tiring than I thought it would be.
"FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE18",FRANKIE_PART1_FRANKIE18
"FRANKIE_PART1_KAYLEIGH19",She’s quite the personality!
"FRANKIE_PART1_MEREDITH19",I’m glad I am no longer the most socially awkward person on the island.

"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE2",[shake rate=30 level=10]THERE MUST COME A MOMENT WHERE EVERY PLUCKY YOUNG ADVENTURER CARVES THEIR OWN PATH~[/shake]
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE3",That’s what I’m doing. [pause]I’m the plucky young adventurer, if you didn’t get where I was going with this.
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE3_OPTION1",I see.
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE4",Anyway, I found one of those “Rogue Fusions” just up ahead – I’m going to go and show it who’s boss!
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE4_OPTION1",Do you need a hand?
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE5",Don’t worry! I have a natural affinity for this – I’ve read over [wave amp=30 freq=10]200[/wave] fanfics about people transforming into monsters. [pause](Please don’t ask me to elaborate on this.)
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE6",[shake rate=30 level=10]Let’s go![/shake]
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE7",[wave amp=30 freq=10]WE DID IT~[/wave]
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE8",My career is coming along quite well, I think!
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE8_OPTION1",Career?
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE9",W-well, my career as a dashing and mysterious heroine who saves the humble people of this fantasy land, of course!
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE11",[wave amp=30 freq=10]AND I SHALL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAVING THIS ISLAND![/wave]
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE11_OPTION1",You’re a bit late.
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE12",Huh? [pause]Y-you have?
"FRANKIE_PART2_FRANKIE13",That’s OK! I’m sure there’ll be SOME evil left somewhere for me to overcome! [pause]You [wave amp=30 freq=10]might[/wave] have missed a spot!
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE1",Hey, {player}! I have a question for you!
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE1_OPTION1",Ask away!
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE2",What does it mean… to take charge of your life?
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE2_OPTION1",That’s a broad question.
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE3",W-well, I should be using my time on New Wirral to fulfil my life, or something! [pause]Save the world! Find my true calling! Fall in love!
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE4",Y’know, all the classic adventure stuff. [pause]I can’t waste a second!
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE4_OPTION1",Maybe your expectations are too high…
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE5",Hmm. [pause]You’re probably right.
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE6",OK, second question! [pause]Can you help me fight a Rogue Fusion I found nearby? I’m sure that’ll be a worthwhile experience!
"FRANKIE_PART3_FRANKIE7",Thanks for the help, {player}! [pause]I have decided that that was indeed a worthwhile experience!
"FRANKIE_PART4_FRANKIE1",FRANKIE_PART4_FRANKIE1
"FRANKIE_PART4_FRANKIE3",...So of course, I’ve tracked down a Rogue Fusion to battle! There’s no time to wait – [shake rate=30 level=10]let’s go pummel it![/shake]
"FRANKIE_PART4_FRANKIE4",Thanks for the assistance! [pause]Perhaps next time you and I meet out in the field, you’ll be seeing me as a fully-fledged ranger!
"FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE1",FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE1
"FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE2",[shake rate=30 level=10]THE STUDENT MUST TAKE ON THE MASTER![/shake] The only way I can become a true ranger is to defeat you and [wave amp=30 freq=10]claim your stamp[/wave]!
"FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE3_OPTION1",Give it your all, rookie!
"FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE4",FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE4
"FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE5_OPTION1",Huh?
"FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE6",You heard correctly – I [wave amp=30 freq=10]already[/wave] qualify for rangerhood!
"FRANKIE_PART5_FRANKIE7",I just wanted to see how tough you were. [pause]You didn’t disappoint!
"POWER_STATION_DREADFUL1",Hold your horses!
"POWER_STATION_DREADFUL3",Hold onto your knickers, ladies and gents – there’s a nasty big blighter here!
"POWER_STATION_DREADFUL4",Shall we show it what we’re made of, then?
"POWER_STATION_DREADFUL5",That was a right ruckus! You take a look around – I need to catch my breath.
"AA_HELIA_NAME",Helia
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA1",AHA, THANK YOU FOR MOPPING UP MY PROGENITORS’ FAILED EXPERIMENTS.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA3_OPTION1",You know me?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA4",I KNOW YOU QUITE WELL. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE YOU FUSED NOW?

WHEREVER THERE IS FUSION, I AM FOUND.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_KAYLEIGH6",Then you’re creating the Rogue Fusions?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_MEREDITH6",Oh. There really is someone behind the Rogue Fusions!
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_EUGENE6",You’re responsible for Rogue Fusions?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_FELIX6",Then the Rogue Fusions…?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_VIOLA6",Then you are behind the Rogue Fusion creatures!
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_DOG6",Grr...
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA7",“ROGUE FUSIONS”?
[pause]
OH, YES.[pause] THE STABLE ONES.[pause] THOSE WONDERFUL BEASTS ARE MY DOING.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA10",THAT’S QUITE ENOUGH OF THAT.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_KAYLEIGH15",Your “wonderful beasts” put Harbourtown in danger!
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_MEREDITH15",Hate to tell you this, but your “wonderful beasts” are hurting people.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_EUGENE15",Come on! We can manage fine without your “wonderful beasts”.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_FELIX15",Can you at least stop making more “wonderful beasts”?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_VIOLA15",I am familiar with the “fusion” of New Wirral, but what is this talk of stars and cells?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA16",AS I SAID, I AM THE PROCESS OF FUSION.

I AM NOT THE CAUSE OF IT.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA18_OPTION1",Then who do we blame?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA19",ULTIMATELY, THE CAUSE OF THE “ROGUE FUSIONS” IS THE ENTITY THAT CEASELESSLY CONJURES THE DEBRIS OF OTHER WORLDS TO THIS LAND.
[pause]
IT IS THE ONE THAT BROUGHT ME, AND YOU – AND INDEED EVERY OTHER HUMAN – HERE.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_KAYLEIGH21",The Mer-Line? I don’t like this, {player}...
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_MEREDITH21",POWER_STATION_HELIA_MEREDITH21
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_EUGENE21",Alright! Let’s go punch some trains!
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_FELIX21",Oh. The railway is behind all this?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_VIOLA21",We shall not be defeated by a mere labyrinth, {player}!
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_DOG21",Grr…
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_PLAYER21_OPTION1",Let’s go meet the Mer-Line.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA22",ONE MORE THING BEFORE YOU LEAVE, {player.to_upper}.

YOU MANIFESTED THE SPIRIT OF REBELLION, MORGANTE, WHEN YOU FOUGHT ALEPH, DID YOU NOT?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA22_OPTION1",Yeah, why?
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_HELIA23",THE SWORD THAT YOU WIELD HAS TWO EDGES.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_DREADFUL28",That was certainly somethin’! [pause]I better report all this back to Ianthe.
"POWER_STATION_HELIA_DREADFUL30",Hmm… [pause]I wonder if “Helia” had anything to do with the fire that burned down New London all those years ago...?
"MAGIKRAB_NAME",Magikrab
"MERLINE_MEETING_MAGIKRAB2",The Mer-Line will now speak through me.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MAGIKRAB3",MERLINE_MEETING_MAGIKRAB3
"AA_MERLINE_NAME",The Mer-Line
"MERLINE_MEETING_MERLINE4",{player.to_upper}, THE MER-LINE WISHES TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR PART IN DEFEATING THEIR WAYWARD STUDENT, ALEPH.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MERLINE7_OPTION1",We had help from Morgante.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MERLINE8",AH YES, MORGANTE. ALEPH’S OLD LOVER.
"MERLINE_MEETING_KEYLEIGH9",Aleph’s… lover?
"MERLINE_MEETING_MEREDITH9",Um… Aleph’s lover?
"MERLINE_MEETING_EUGENE9",What?!
"MERLINE_MEETING_FELIX9",She’s Aleph’s lover?
"MERLINE_MEETING_VIOLA9",...
"MERLINE_MEETING_MERLINE10",REBELLION AND CONQUEST WEREN’T ALWAYS ENEMIES.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MERLINE16",SPEAK YOUR MIND, {player.to_upper}. THE MER-LINE KNOWS YOU HAVE A REQUEST.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MERLINE16_OPTION1",You need to stop the Rogue Fusions!
"MERLINE_MEETING_MERLINE17",THE MER-LINE COULD STOP THE "ROGUE FUSIONS".
"MERLINE_MEETING_MERLINE20",IT IS LONG PAST TIME FOR YOU TO RETURN TO YOUR OWN WORLDS, {player.to_upper} AND {partner.to_upper}.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MAGIKRAB22",Oh. {player}.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MAGIKRAB23_OPTION1",The Mer-Line was talking through you.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MAGIKRAB24",MERLINE_MEETING_MAGIKRAB24
"MERLINE_MEETING_KAYLEIGH25",Hmm. Maybe Ianthe will know what to do.
"MERLINE_MEETING_MEREDITH25",That didn’t go how I expected.
"MERLINE_MEETING_EUGENE25",Well, maybe it’s for the best that we don't fight this one. You know what Helia said about Aleph...
"MERLINE_MEETING_FELIX25",Do you think they’re telling the truth? About our worlds needing us?
"MERLINE_MEETING_VIOLA25",Perhaps this “Mer-Line” speaks the truth.
"NOTICEBOARD_QUEST_HOYLAKE_FUSION_HOYLAKE1",Greetings, {player}!
"NOTICEBOARD_QUEST_HOYLAKE_FUSION_HOYLAKE4",How fascinating! Thank you very much for this, {player}.

"HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE1",HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE1
"HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE1_OPTION1",The unknown?
"HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE2",Indeed! [pause]As we all find ourselves marooned in this curious realm, it falls upon a steadfast and [wave amp=30 freq=10]rational mind[/wave] to make sense of the chaos that surrounds us.
"HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE4",The humble townsfolk describe many strange beasts on this island. [pause]If we were to catalogue them, [pause]then the unknown would cease to [wave amp=30 freq=10]BE[/wave] unknown.
"HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE5",HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE5
"HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE5_OPTION1",Sure!
"HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE5_OPTION2",Not now.
"HOYLAKE_INTRO_HOYLAKE_NO",Ah, [pause]that’s a shame. If you happen to change your mind, let me know! [pause]Science shall persevere regardless!
"HOYLAKE_PART1_HOYLAKE1",Excellent! [pause]Wonderful! [pause]I have some descriptions of monsters I’ve sourced from Harbourtown’s populace. If you can record these monster forms, I’ll be able to catalogue them.
"HOYLAKE_PART1_HOYLAKE2",The first account I have is “{monster_description}, spotted {habitat_phrase}”.
"HOYLAKE_PART1_HOYLAKE4",HOYLAKE_PART1_HOYLAKE4
"HOYLAKE_INTERACT_HOYLAKE1",HOYLAKE_INTERACT_HOYLAKE1
"HOYLAKE_INTERACT_HOYLAKE1_OPTION1",Here it is!
"HOYLAKE_INTERACT_HOYLAKE_NO",Worry not! [pause]I’m sure the enigmatic creature will reveal itself soon enough! [pause]Progress is inevitable, after all!
"HOYLAKE_PART2_HOYLAKE1_RAND",Excellent! The “{monster_name}”, is it? [pause]Yes, this indeed matches up with my reports perfectly!
"HOYLAKE_PART2_HOYLAKE1",Excellent! The “Macabra”, is it? [pause]The fangs… the skull. [pause]Yes, this indeed matches up with my reports perfectly!
"HOYLAKE_PART2_HOYLAKE2",Recording monsters with cassette tapes to transform into them... [pause]it doesn’t make rational sense, and yet we see it happening before our eyes.
"HOYLAKE_PART2_HOYLAKE4",Thank you for your work! Here’s some compensation for your time!
"HOYLAKE_PART2_HOYLAKE5",Now for your next assignment...
"HOYLAKE_PART2_HOYLAKE6",A young ranger recently reported “{monster_description}, spotted {habitat_phrase}”. [pause]This sounds like a task for you, no doubt!
"HOYLAKE_PART3_HOYLAKE1_RAND",My, my! [pause]The “{monster_name}”, is it? [pause]Why you would want to transform into this thing, I do not know…
"HOYLAKE_PART3_HOYLAKE1",My, my! [pause]The “Stardigrade” is indeed a disturbing beast! [pause]Why you would want to transform into this wretched thing, I do not know…
"HOYLAKE_PART3_HOYLAKE2",Truth be told, [pause]I don’t want to transform into ANY beast! [pause]I don’t understand how this technology works, and I’d rather not experiment on [wave amp=30 freq=10]myself[/wave].
"HOYLAKE_PART3_HOYLAKE3",I’m perfectly happy leaving the monster transforming to others… [pause]Which reminds me: here’s a reward for your efforts!
"HOYLAKE_PART3_HOYLAKE4",The next rumour I’ve heard sounds too bizarre to be true. There are claims of “{monster_description}, spotted {habitat_phrase}”.
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE1",Huh?! [pause]It was REAL?! [pause]I never would have guessed.
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE2_RAND",The “{monster_name}”, I see.
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE2",The “Thwackalope”, I see. [pause]On earth, well, my earth at least, [pause]there is a mythical creature known as a “jackalope” that is very similar.
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE3",It is curious how our myths and legends appear to influence the appearance of monsters here on New Wirral…
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE4_OPTION1",Sure…?
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE5",Excellent! [pause]I will simply ask a series of questions relating to broad historical events and you can tell me if they seem familiar to you.
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE6_OPTION1",Yes!
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE7",Question two: [pause]did the “industrial revolution” occur in your world’s past?
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE7_OPTION1",Yes!
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE8",OK, question three: [pause]did mankind ever land on the moon?
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE8_OPTION1",Yes!
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE9",Right! [pause]Last question: has “The Day of the Birds” happened yet?
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE9_OPTION1",What?
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE10",HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE10
"HOYLAKE_PART4_HOYLAKE11",Thank you for your assistance once again! [pause]Take this for your troubles.

"HOYLAKE_PART5_HOYLAKE1",HOYLAKE_PART5_HOYLAKE1
"HOYLAKE_PART5_HOYLAKE2_RAND",“{monster_name}”, is it?
"HOYLAKE_PART5_HOYLAKE2",“Nevermort”, is it? [pause]Quite a morbid appearance it has! [pause]It makes me think of a poem… [pause]though I can’t remember what poem, exactly.
"HOYLAKE_PART5_HOYLAKE3",Alas, we have but one monster left on my list of pressing investigations!
"HOYLAKE_PART5_HOYLAKE4",Ianthe herself has spoken of a creature that flees if it catches even a glimpse of a human being! 
"HOYLAKE_PART5_HOYLAKE5",It is supposedly “{monster_description} {habitat_phrase}”. [pause]If this sounds like something you will be able to record, [pause]I wish you good fortune! 
"HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE1_RAND",Oh, you managed to record it! [pause]The “{monster_name}”, aye?
"HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE1",Oh, you managed to record it! [pause]An “Elfless”, aye? [pause]So enigmatic, that it covers its face. [pause]Now that I think about it, there are rather a lot of monsters on New Wirral wearing masks.
"HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE2",What could the significance of this be? [pause]Perhaps there is some deep psychic connection between how human beings perceive faces, and how these monsters manifest into being…
"HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE4",HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE4
"HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE5",The truth is, [pause]I’m not [wave amp=30 freq=10]actually[/wave] a professor or a scientist.
"HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE9",HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE9
"HOYLAKE_PART6_HOYLAKE10",If you ever want to help my cataloguing further, come chat with me again. [pause]There’ll always be something new to investigate!
"HOYLAKE_PART8_HOYLAKE3",Greetings, {player}! When I have a request for you I’ll leave it on the noticeboard outside!
"HOYLAKE_PART8_HOYLAKE1",Greetings, {player}! I’m still busy cataloguing the species you recorded earlier.
"HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE1",Greetings, {player}! How many different species have you recorded out there?
"HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE2",Goodness gracious! {count}!?
"HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE3",Thank you for your work! Here’s some compensation for your time!
"HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE4",That must be all the known monsters in New Wirral! [pause]Well, [pause]except for the bootlegs, fusions, and Archangels.
"HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE7",When I have a request for you I’ll leave it on the noticeboard outside!
"HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE6",HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE6
"HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE9",Come chat with me again when you reach {next_threshold}.
"HOYLAKE_PART7_HOYLAKE8",{count}? Not bad, not bad.
"SUNNY_EUGENEDATE_SUNNY1",[wave amp=20 freq=5]…I just don’t think it’s… [pause]I think we should just be friends.[/wave]
"SUNNY_EUGENEDATE_EUGENE2",Is this because of my whole “campaign to take down the Landkeepers” thing? [pause]I know we’re an [wave amp=30 freq=10]unlikely pair[/wave] but I can’t stop thinking about you.
"SUNNY_EUGENEDATE_SUNNY4",[wave amp=20 freq=5]No, it’s not that. [pause]I’m not a Landkeeper now. [pause]I think…[/wave]
"SUNNY_EUGENEDATE_SUNNY5",[wave amp=20 freq=5]I haven’t been “Sunny” for long. [pause]I need more time to be me.[/wave]
"SUNNY_EUGENEDATE_SUNNY6",[wave amp=20 freq=5]I have enjoyed our “date”, though.[/wave]
"SUNNY_EUGENEDATE_EUGENE7",I understand. [pause]Don’t worry about it, Sunny.
"SUNNY_UNKNOWN_NAME",Dishevelled Landkeeper
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY1",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Uuuuuuuuuuh...[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_EUGENE2",[shake rate=30 level=10]LANDKEEPER![/shake][pause][pause] Let me guess, you’re crawling back for revenge after we brought down your whole operation,[pause] huh?!
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY3",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Buuuuuuuuuh...[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_KAYLEIGH4",Eugene, [pause]I think there’s something wrong with her. [pause]I think she’s,[pause] uh, [pause]broken.
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY5",[wave amp=10 freq=5]Whuuhhhh…?[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_EUGENE6",I… [pause]I think you might be right.
"SUNNY_INTRO_KAYLEIGH7",Sorry about the hostile reception. [pause]Why don’t you take a seat and we can get to know each other?
"SUNNY_INTRO_KAYLEIGH8",So, [pause]uh, [pause]are you feeling OK? Can you tell us about yourself?
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY9",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Profits… [pause]down....[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_EUGENE10",The Landkeepers were minions of an Archangel we defeated. [pause]Maybe when their boss fled, all their brains got fried? [pause]I still don’t trust her.
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY11",[wave amp=20 freq=5]No… [pause]job.... [pause]prospects...[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_EUGENE12",She doesn’t exactly have a sunny disposition, does she?
"SUNNY_INTRO_KAYLEIGH13",“Sunny”? [pause]Why don’t we call her Sunny? We have to call her something!
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY14",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Sunny....[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY14_OPTION1",What happened to you?
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY15",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Landkeepers… [pause]bankrupt.... [pause]nothing… left....[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_EUGENE17",Maybe the Landkeepers only exist to carry out their jobs, and now she doesn’t know what else there is to do. [pause]Like a machine without a purpose.
"SUNNY_INTRO_KAYLEIGH18",Oh, you poor thing! [pause]There’s still plenty of time for you to make a fresh start!
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY19",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Fresh… [pause]start…?[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_KAYLEIGH20",Maybe the first step is getting you some new clothes, Sunny. [pause]I’m sure wearing that office outfit all day is pretty miserable!
"SUNNY_INTRO_SUNNY21",[wave amp=20 freq=5]...[/wave]
"SUNNY_INTRO_KAYLEIGH22",Then it’s agreed! [pause]{player}, [pause]let’s meet up at Harbourtown’s tailor. [pause]It’s on the upper level of Harbourtown, just north of here.
"SUNNY_PART2_KAYLEIGH1",Oh, hey! [pause]Everyone’s here!
"SUNNY_PART2_EUGENE2",I’m still not sure we should be helping her out. [pause]Are you forgetting the time her former employer tried to take over the island?
"SUNNY_PART2_MEREDITH3",This could be interesting.
"SUNNY_PART2_FELIX3",I’m here for moral support.
"SUNNY_PART2_VIOLA3",I am curious! Perhaps this shall be entertaining?
"SUNNY_PART2_SUNNY4",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Whuhh…?[/wave]
"SUNNY_PART2_KAYLEIGH5",Right, [pause]Sunny, [pause]I’ll take you back here and you can pick out some new outfits.
"SUNNY_PART2_SUNNY6",[wave amp=20 freq=5]OK...[/wave]
"SUNNY_PART2_SUNNY7",[wave amp=20 freq=5]This… OK…?[/wave]
"SUNNY_PART2_EUGENE8",I’m not sure about this, Kayleigh…
"SUNNY_PART2_MEREDITH9",I’m having a [wave amp=30 freq=10]great[/wave] time already.
"SUNNY_PART2_FELIX10",It’s a start!
"SUNNY_PART2_VIOLA11",Hmm. [pause]Perhaps this maiden is even more unfamiliar with the styles and fashions of this land than I.
"SUNNY_PART2_KAYLEIGH12",I’m not sure about this one, [pause]Sunny!
"SUNNY_PART2_SUNNY13",[wave amp=20 freq=5]I’m not… sure...[/wave]
"SUNNY_PART2_EUGENE14",That’s not the direction I was expecting you to go.
"SUNNY_PART2_KAYLEIGH15",You don’t look super comfortable in that, Sunny… [pause]How about we try another?
"SUNNY_PART2_SUNNY16",[wave amp=20 freq=5]I think I… [pause]look good.[/wave]
"SUNNY_PART2_EUGENE17",I…
"SUNNY_PART2_KAYLEIGH19",Absolutely [wave amp=30 freq=10]gorgeous[/wave]? [pause]No, [pause]that’s not just you.
"SUNNY_PART2_MEREDITH20",OK, [pause]it turns out Sunny is actually cool. [pause]Who knew?
"SUNNY_PART2_FELIX20",I think Sunny’s found her look.
"SUNNY_PART2_VIOLA20",Quite unexpected. [pause]Quite.
"SUNNY_PART2_PLAYER21_OPTION1",You look cool, Sunny!
"SUNNY_PART2_SUNNY22",[wave amp=20 freq=5]OK. [pause]This is me now... [/wave]
"SUNNY_PART2_SUNNY23",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Thanks for the help… [pause]all of you.[/wave]
"SUNNY_PART2_EUGENE24",I have some VERY mixed emotions right now.
"SUNNY_PART2_KAYLEIGH25",We’re glad to be able to help you, Sunny.
"SUNNY_PART2_SUNNY27",[wave amp=20 freq=5]Landkeepers are not “zombies”. [pause]Landkeepers are vessels. [pause]Created to work.[/wave]

"VIN_NAME",Vin
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_VIN2",Hey {player}. I’ve finally passed my training and become a full-time ranger!
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_KAYLEIGH3",I never would have figured these two would end up friends!
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_MEREDITH3",These two ended up as mates? I guess that figures.
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_EUGENE3",Heh. I guess these two are buddies now?
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FELIX3",I didn’t realise you two knew each other! I suppose it’s a small island.
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_VIOLA3",I would never have assumed a friendship between such two different individuals!
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE4",Uh, I have some news too.
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE6",Captain Cybil says wild monsters don’t make great pets, but…[pause] I’m certain it was the fanfic I wrote about him.
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE7",But not to worry! My new [wave amp=30 freq=10]best buddy[/wave] Vin doesn’t mind that stuff!
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_VIN8",What’s a fanfic, {player}? She won’t tell me…
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE9",AHHHH~!
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE10",VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE10
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE10_OPTION1",Sure!
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE10_OPTION2",Not now.
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE11",Ahh… [pause]Not again!
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_VIN12",Chin up, Frankie. We can’t win them all.
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_VIN13",{player}, it wasn’t until I fused with Frankie that I realised relying on others isn’t a weakness.
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_VIN14",When we combine our efforts, we’re more than simply the sum of our parts. [pause]That’s what all this is about, isn’t it?
"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE15",[wave amp=30 freq=10]AND SO THE PLUCKY HEROINE AIDS THE ANTI-HERO’S REDEMPTION ARC THROUGH THE POWER OF LOVE~![/wave]

"VIN_AND_FRANKIE_FRANKIE18",Seeya, {player}!
"THIEF_NAME",Thief
"VIN_PART1_VIN1",VIN_PART1_VIN1
"VIN_PART1_VIN1_OPTION1",Something like that.
"VIN_PART1_VIN2",Fine! [pause]If you’re gonna fight me, fight me one-on-one!
"VIN_PART1_KAYLEIGH4",Don’t worry, {player}! I’ll sit this one out – you can take out this guy without me!

"VIN_PART1_VIN5",VIN_PART1_VIN5
"VIN_PART1_KAYLEIGH7",He ran pretty fast. I’m sure we’ll catch him next time, {player}.
"VIN_PART1_MEREDITH7",VIN_PART1_MEREDITH7
"VIN_PART1_EUGENE7",Despite all that bravado, he was pretty quick to flee, huh?
"VIN_PART1_FELIX7",He’s a pretty fast runner. I guess we’ll catch him next time.
"VIN_PART1_VIOLA7",He was quick to exit the stage of battle. I am sure our paths will cross again.
"VIN_PART2_VIN1",[shake rate=30 level=10]It’s you again![/shake]
"VIN_PART2_VIN4",Heh, you’ll never catch me. And I’ll never give up...

"VIN_PART3_EUGENE5",Hey! A lot more than just Dorian would have died if not for {player}!
"VIN_PART3_FELIX5",Wait, so this thief guy is part of that weird cult?
"VIN_PART3_VIOLA5",You are mistaken, thief!
"VIN_PART3_VIN6",VIN_PART3_VIN6
"VIN_PART3_VIN7",When our leader was [wave amp=30 freq=10]cruelly slain[/wave], you rangers immediately started trying to “offer us help”. Yeah right.
"VIN_PART3_KAYLEIGH9",You’ve gotten this all wrong. [pause]Dorian was responsible for everything your community went through!
"VIN_PART3_VIN10",The blank tapes and stickers I’m stealing… They’re gonna be for our resistance!
"VIN_PART5_VIN1",Hey, {player}.
"VIN_PART5_VIN3",I regret messing up like I did, but... [pause]in the end I did it because I wanted to support my community.
"VIN_PART5_VIN4",So I joined the rangers to do just that! And make up for my mistakes, of course.
"VIN_PART5_KAYLEIGH5",Brilliant! [pause]I’m glad you’re turning things around for yourself, Vin!
"VIN_PART5_MEREDITH5",Yeah, it sounds like you’ve got a lot of work to do, mate.
"VIN_PART5_EUGENE5",Sounds like you’ve found your own personal cause. I respect that.
"VIN_PART5_FELIX5",Glad to see you’ve had a real change of heart.
"VIN_PART5_VIOLA5",All’s well that ends well.
"VIN_PART5_VIN6",And now I must challenge you for your stamp! [pause]Come on, fight me [wave amp=30 freq=10]one-on-one[/wave], {player}!

"WORKING_OVERTIME_ACTIVE_RANGER1_OPTION2",Not yet!
"WORKING_OVERTIME_ACTIVE_RANGER_NO",Don’t worry about it. I ain’t leaving here anytime soon.
"WORKING_OVERTIME_ACTIVE_RANGER1_OPTION1",Hand him {required_item_amount} wood.
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_RANGER2",You did it! [pause]Thanks for your help – I was dreading the thought of collecting all those materials myself.
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_RANGER3",Hmm... [pause][pause]since you helped me out, [pause]why don’t you decide on the design?
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_RANGER4_OPTION1",A bird!
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_RANGER5",Alright, [pause]let’s go with that.
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_RANGER6",Phew. [pause][pause]All done. [pause]What do you think?
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_RANGER6_OPTION1",I love it!
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_KAYLEIGH7",Brilliant work!
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_MEREDITH7",Pretty neat work, mate.
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_EUGENE7",Heh. [pause]Nice work, man.
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_FELIX7",Neat sign.
"WORKING_OVERTIME_COMPLETE_VIOLA7",I can see that you have worked diligently on this piece.
"WORKING_OVERTIME_INITIAL_RANGER1",Hey, [pause]any chance you could lend a hand?
"WORKING_OVERTIME_INITIAL_RANGER3",Only I’ve miscalculated how much wood it would take. Any chance you could source me some spare wood? [pause]That would be a real lifesaver!
"WORKING_OVERTIME_INITIAL_RANGER3_OPTION1",Sure!
"WORKING_OVERTIME_INITIAL_RANGER4",Really? Thanks! [pause]Come say hi when you’ve got the materials. 
"WORKING_OVERTIME_INITIAL_RANGER_NO",Hey, don’t worry about it.
"VIOLA_INTRO1_KAYLEIGH1",I’m a little concerned about this…
"VIOLA_INTRO1_MEREDITH1",Ugh, typical. There’s always something trying to kill us, isn’t there?
"VIOLA_INTRO1_EUGENE1",The more opponents, the better the workout, [pause]right?
"VIOLA_INTRO1_FELIX1",...Oh. I guess this was an ambush.
"VIOLA_UNKNOWN_NAME",Mysterious Woman
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA2",This country shows no kindness, strangers. 
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA3",Come – [pause]let us match these beasts in number!
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA4",…
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA5",You would do well to leave before those fiends return...
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA6",You surely have no reason to remain in such a place as this.
"VIOLA_INTRO1_KAYLEIGH7",At least let us thank you! Who are you?
"VIOLA_INTRO1_MEREDITH7",Nice hat. Who are you, anyway?
"VIOLA_INTRO1_EUGENE7",C’mon, [pause]we’re battle buddies! [pause]At least tell us your name.
"VIOLA_INTRO1_FELIX7",That was a pretty dramatic fight. [pause]Can you at least tell us your name?
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA8",I am Viola of Messaline.
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA9",I am no fighter, but this land has thrust such a role upon me.
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA10_OPTION1",What is your burden?
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA11",...
"VIOLA_INTRO1_VIOLA12",My brother and I were both cast to the seas.
"VIOLA_INTRO2_VIOLA1",We meet again. How fares thee?
"VIOLA_INTRO2_VIOLA1_OPTION1",Where might your brother be?
"VIOLA_INTRO2_VIOLA2",I know not.
"VIOLA_INTRO2_VIOLA4",I do not know this country, nor do I know its customs.
"VIOLA_INTRO2_VIOLA6",From my perspective, [pause]it is thee who speaks with a curious dialect.
"VIOLA_INTRO2_VIOLA8",Farewell.
"SEBASTIAN_NAME",Sebastian
"VIOLA_QUEST1_PART1_SEBASTIAN1",[wave amp=30 freq=10]TELL MY SISTER… SHE IS TO MEET ME HERE…[/wave]
"VIOLA_QUEST1_PART1_KAYLEIGH2",Was that Viola’s brother? We should tell her…
"VIOLA_QUEST1_PART1_MEREDITH2",I, uh, don’t know what to make of that. We should tell Viola I guess.
"VIOLA_QUEST1_PART1_EUGENE2",That was pretty weird, huh? C’mon, let’s go tell Viola.
"VIOLA_QUEST1_PART1_FELIX2",This story is getting weirder. C’mon, we should go tell Viola we saw her brother.
"VIOLA_QUEST2_PART1_VIOLA1",What’s that – you saw a vision of my brother?
"VIOLA_QUEST2_PART1_VIOLA3",I see…
"VIOLA_QUEST2_PART1_VIOLA4",My brother may still be among the living, [pause]or perhaps only his soul instead lingers…
"VIOLA_QUEST2_PART1_VIOLA6_OPTION1",Sure!
"VIOLA_QUEST2_PART1_VIOLA7",Let us travel with haste. 
"VIOLA_QUEST2_PART1_VIOLA_NO",I understand. I shall remain here for now, then.
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART1_VIOLA1",This is the place?
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART1_VIOLA2",My brother, [pause]if you are in this place… [pause]Speak to me.
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART1_VIOLA3",Let us search this place, and then be rid of it.
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART2_VIOLA1",Brother?!
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART2_SEBASTIAN2",I have waited many moons to meet you, [wave amp=30 freq=10]Viola of Messaline.[/wave]
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART2_VIOLA4",…[pause] You do not deceive me, spirit. [pause]I shall not play your games.
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART2_SEBASTIAN5",No? [pause]But the night’s festivities have not yet even begun!
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART2_SEBASTIAN6",COME, VIOLA OF MESSALINE.

YOU SHALL FIND YOUR FAMILY WITHIN.

FOR I AM YOUR BROTHER’S KEEPER.
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART2_VIOLA7",...
"VIOLA_QUEST3_PART2_VIOLA8",I spare little faith in the words of this spirit. [pause]But if it knows of Sebastian, [pause]and my name…
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA1",Thank you for accompanying me on this quest, [pause]{player}. 
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA3",It may be that my life is but a story in other realms, but…
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA4",It matters not. My future is mine to write.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA6",But from the moment we tied our hearts together in battle, [pause]you have become part of my story too.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA6_OPTION1",”Tied our hearts”?
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA7",I refer to our [wave amp=30 freq=10]moment of union[/wave] in our great battle. When we became of one body, I felt our [wave amp=30 freq=10]fates[/wave] intertwine also.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA9_OPTION1",That’s right!
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA10",Perhaps if this is found, then I shall be reunited with my brother.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_EPILOGUE_VIOLA11",Very well! [pause]Let me repay my debt: I shall aid you in your own journey.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PART1_ROBIN1",CARE TO DANCE, COUSIN?
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PART1_VIOLA1",No. [pause]You are not my kin, spirit.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PART2_VIOLA1",This must be the lair of the spirit who keeps my brother from me.
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PART2_VIOLA1_OPTION1",I think it’s an Archangel…
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PART2_VIOLA2",Whatever spirit, fairy, or devil seeks an audience with me…
"VIOLA_QUEST4_PART2_VIOLA3",I will not falter!
"VIOLA_QUEST4_FUSE_VIOLA1",{player}...
"VIOLA_QUEST4_FUSE_VIOLA2",The overwhelming hand of fate may push against us, [pause]but…
"VIOLA_QUEST4_FUSE_VIOLA3",We shall not perish upon this day!
"ALEPH_LORE_1",Aleph once lead a troupe of Archangels across the connected cosmos. There, he commanded great battles, becoming a part of many common legends known to this very day. His portal head allows him to send anyone and anything anywhere he wants – except himself.
"ALEPH_NULL_LORE_1",Aleph, once again as strong as he was at the height of his power. If he is allowed to roam the connected cosmos as he once did, it is no doubt that an unquestionable amount of suffering will happen.
"AA_ALICE_NAME",Alice
"ALICE_LORE_1",Alice sees herself as a benevolent princess of her own domain. The prospect of visiting guests excites her, but only in that she sees people as playthings that can be easily discarded after their novelty runs thin.
"AA_AMBER_NAME",The Amber Lodge
"AA_AMBER_LORE_1",Ms. Amber is an enigmatic but hospitable Archangel, who offers safe passage to travellers of the cosmos. She has the ability to travel freely between worlds, and takes the form of a high-class club filled with guests.
"AA_CUBE_NAME",Heckahedron
"CUBE_LORE_1",Heckahedron’s body is “cardinally fixed”, meaning it looks the exact same regardless of what angle you view it from. This isn’t unusual – the “physical form” of any Archangel is merely the 3-dimensional shadow of a higher being. They are not bound by euclidean science.
"FINALGANTE_LORE_1",The will to fight back against impossible odds, along with the remnant spirit of Morgante, has formed Morgante Gestalt. It is an Egregore – known as an “Archangel” on New Wirral – an entity created by a combined will to change reality. This power resides in all of mankind.
"HELIA_LORE_1",An incarnation of the power of fusion, Helia oversees all kinds of fusion throughout the cosmos. On her home world, she first manifested in the research laboratory of human scientists who were studying nuclear fusion.
"AA_LAMENTO_MORI_NAME",Lamento Mori
"LAMENTO_MORI_LORE_1",Lamento Mori, a particularly powerful Archangel for its age, has turned its station platform into a maze of tomb-like chambers, in which it traps and torments any unfortunate soul who dares enter its depths.
"LENNA_LORE_1",Lenna once lived as an unassuming school teacher, whose biggest responsibility was to instruct the “hero” of her world on how to fight the evil Archangels. When the hero was unexpectedly killed, Lenna took up the sword herself.

"TUTORIAL_AP1",Pay attention to these orange squares – they are your Action Points, or AP for short.

Most moves require you to spend some AP. The amount of AP a move costs is shown next to its name.

If you don’t have enough AP for a move, you won’t be able to use it this turn.
"TUTORIAL_AP2",Each party member gets 2 AP each turn, and an extra 1 if they land a type-advantaged attack.

You can plan ahead and save up AP for your most powerful attacks by using weaker, low-AP moves.
"TUTORIAL_ARCHANGEL_AP",Unlike other monsters that spend AP to use moves, Archangels accumulate all their AP until it reaches 10.

Once an Archangel reaches 10 AP it unleashes all that power at once in its unique Angelic Attack.

To survive, use your moves strategically to either set up a solid defence in preparation, or defeat the Archangel before it gets enough AP.

"TUTORIAL_FUSION1",TUTORIAL_FUSION1
"TUTORIAL_FUSION2",As a fusion, you gain 4 AP each turn instead of 2, allowing you to make use of your more powerful moves sooner.

You also have access to all the moves of both tapes combined, and your stats are added together.
"TUTORIAL_RECORDING1",Whether a recording succeeds or not is down to chance. However, several factors affect the probability of success:

- How much health the monster has,
- Its level and rarity,
- How much damage you dealt it while recording,
- And how much damage the person recording it took.
"TUTORIAL_RECORDING2",Buffing your attacks—or debuffing the target’s defences—can be an effective way to increase the damage you deal the target, and improve the odds in your favour.

As long as a monster is being recorded, it cannot flee or be defeated, so you don’t need to worry about knocking it out!
"TUTORIAL_RELATIONSHIPS",Building relationships with your friends is really important. The strength of your relationship directly affects how strong you are when fused together!

You can get closer to someone by completing their quests, and by battling alongside them. When the time is right, you can take a break at a campfire, or in the cafe, to level up your relationship.
"TUTORIAL_REMASTER",Certain tapes can be ‘remastered’ when they reach 5 stars.

Remastering a tape evolves it into a more powerful form. Its stats will grow, and it’ll learn new moves.

Some monster forms can only be obtained through remastering, and in some cases, the remastered tape can be different depending on various conditions.

Remaster tapes whenever you can!
"TUTORIAL_ROGUE_FUSIONS1",This monster is what the Rangers call a “Rogue Fusion”. Sometimes they hide inside chests found in underground caves.

Battling Rogue Fusions can be a great way to earn valuable items, and experience points, as well as find certain rare monsters. But note that they’re always a lot more dangerous than other monsters in the area!
"TUTORIAL_ROGUE_FUSIONS2",TUTORIAL_ROGUE_FUSIONS2
"TUTORIAL_RUMORS_DESCRIPTION2",The rumours you gather in Harbourtown are tracked in your Quest Log.

Harbourtown is the best place to stock up on supplies, so remember to check for new rumours whenever you're there!
"TUTORIAL_STATIONS1",Fast travel can be activated on the map screen anytime you’re outdoors.

At first you will only be able to travel back to the Gramophone Café. However, each station that you reopen adds a new destination for you to use.
"TUTORIAL_STATIONS2",The Mer-Line’s stations themselves seem to play host to strange beings from far away.

Thoroughly exploring these stations may yield valuable information and rewards.
"TUTORIAL_STICKERS1",The moves you have access to when using a tape in battle are determined by what stickers are attached to the tape.

You can give new moves to a tape by ‘applying’ stickers from your inventory. Moves you don’t want can be ‘peeled’ as stickers and put in your inventory.
"TUTORIAL_STICKERS2",Stickers can be used as many times as you want, but can only be applied to a single tape at a time.

Stickers can be obtained in a few ways:

- By filling tapes’ experience point bars.
- From chests or caches you find.
- From certain merchants in Harbourtown.

"END_MIRROR_REVEAL_MEREDITH1",This… [pause]Seems like a pretty significant find. 
"END_MIRROR_REVEAL_EUGENE1",Whoa.
"END_MIRROR_REVEAL_FELIX1",...Cool.
"END_MIRROR_REVEAL_VIOLA1",Could this be the domain your heart was set on discovering, {player}?

"PARK_CAVE2_MERCHANT1",Hey, you over there! These monsters have me cornered. Could you give me a hand here?
"PARK_CAVE2_MERCHANT2",Oh no, they’ve fused! [wave amp=30 freq=30]HELP![/wave]
"PARK_CAVE2_MERCHANT3",Whew, thanks for that. I came in here looking for some sticker ideas, but I ended up getting more than I bargained for.
"PARK_CAVE2_MERCHANT4",Say... Did you notice Southpaw’s move ‘Magnet’ activates automatically at the start of battle?
"PASSIVE_CAVE_PARKCAVE2_KAYLEIGH",I think the townsfolk used to mine stuff down here in the past…
"PASSIVE_CAVE_PARKCAVE2_MEREDITH",This cave used to be some sort of mine, right? It looks like it’s seen better days.
"PASSIVE_CAVE_PARKCAVE2_EUGENE",I bet we’ll find some tough monsters down here. Stay on your guard, buddy.
"HARBOURTOWN_BOOK_6",The scribbled notes say: “...this reptilian student of the arcane arts can reach its maximum potential if given a tome of magic to study.”
"OVERWORLD_SPIDERCAVE_KAYLEIGH",Are these… spider webs? They’re a [wave amp=30 freq=10]little big[/wave], don’t you think?
"OVERWORLD_SPIDERCAVE_MEREDITH",Are you seeing the [shake rate=30 level=10]size[/shake] of these webs?! [pause]Nah. [pause]NO way. [pause]Let’s swerve this.
"OVERWORLD_SPIDERCAVE_EUGENE",Big webs? [pause]That must mean big bugs. I’m itching for a fight, alright.
"OVERWORLD_SPIDERCAVE_FELIX",I don’t think we’ve stumbled upon giant spider webs before now. That strikes me as the kind of detail I’d remember if we had.
"OVERWORLD_SPIDERCAVE_VIOLA",Do the spiders of this land often weave webs of such… grand scale?
"PICKSIE_ENCOUNTER_KAYLEIGH_1",Oh, did we startle that monster? It looks like it escaped into the ground. Next time we find it somewhere, let’s try to sneak up on it without it seeing us.
"PICKSIE_ENCOUNTER_MEREDITH_1",Did that monster just bury into the ground? If we see it again somewhere, maybe we should try and sneak up on it without it seeing us.
"PICKSIE_ENCOUNTER_EUGENE_1",Aw man, it bailed on us! Maybe if we see it again somewhere, we should try and sneak up behind it so it doesn’t see us and flee again.
"PICKSIE_ENCOUNTER_FELIX_1",Did it just… bury into the ground? Maybe it’s skittish around humans. If we see it again somewhere, maybe we should try and approach it without being seen.
"PICKSIE_ENCOUNTER_VIOLA_1",It seems we caught this spirit unawares. If we cross paths with it again in our travels, perhaps we would be wise to approach it unseen?

"COMMUNE_CULTIST_1_FRIENDLY1",Sorry about all the hostilities.
"COMMUNE_CULTIST_2_FRIENDLY1",So Brother Cooper’s “serpent god” was just some messed-up monster?
"COMMUNE_CULTIST_4_FRIENDLY1",So these “Archangels” live beneath the island… And harbour no love for mankind…
"COMMUNE_CULTIST_5_FRIENDLY1",I guess now that we’re trying to integrate with the rest of the island more…
"COMMUNE_CULTIST_8_FRIENDLY",Does Harbourtown have good food? I’m asking on behalf of my stomach.

"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_GLOWSHROOM_KAYLEIGH",I’ve never seen mushrooms like this before! They’re pretty grand, right?
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_GLOWSHROOM_MEREDITH",These giant mushrooms really add to the “creepy nightclub” ambience.
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_GLOWSHROOM_EUGENE",These are some pretty big mushrooms, buddy.
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_GLOWSHROOM_FELIX",These mushrooms are neat! I should sketch them.
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_GLOWSHROOM_VIOLA",Is that a mushroom? The flora and fauna of this land continues to surprise me.
"MAGIKRAB_PLATFORMB_LAMENTO_MORI1",We have an arrival due at Platform B any minute now!

A DEAD END, YOU MIGHT SAY.
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_ALDGRAVE_KAYLEIGH",I’m gonna try really hard to ignore that [wave amp=30 freq=10]our names[/wave] are on these gravestones, OK?
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_ALDGRAVE_MEREDITH",Oh. Great. Creepy gravestones. This bodes well.
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_ALDGRAVE_EUGENE",Is that my name written there…?
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_ALDGRAVE_FELIX",I don’t feel super great about those creepy gravestones with our names on them.
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_ALDGRAVE_VIOLA",This is a half-hearted attempt to fill our hearts with fear. Do not fall for it.
"DUNGEON_GRAVEYARD_LM_3",SHOW ME HOW MUCH YOU WISH TO SURVIVE.

FIGHT FOR YOUR VERY LIVES!
"DUNGEON_GRAVEYARD_LM_KILL",AMUSING. I WISH TO SEE MORE.
"DUNGEON_GRAVEYARD_LM_5",I’VE CHANGED MY MIND. 

YOU’LL REST WHEN YOU’RE SIX FEET UNDER.
"DUNGEON_GRAVEYARD_LM_4",A REWARD FOR YOUR  EFFORTS. REST UP, WEARY ONES.

"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_MALL_EUGENE",Where I’m from, there’s empty buildings like this across the whole country…
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_MALL_FELIX",It feels pretty strange to be in a building this big on New Wirral.
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_MALL_VIOLA",Such vast and silent halls…
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_PART3_MEREDITH1",It must be around here somewhere… I’m so close...
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_VINYL_DESCRIPTION1",“Mac and the Awesome 5 – Mac to the Future”. This isn’t it.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_VINYL_DESCRIPTION2",“Procgen – Dreamer of Electric Sheep”. Sounds cool... Not the right record, though.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_VINYL_DESCRIPTION3",“Treeman – Legacy of the Treeman” There are some weird records here.
"MEREDITH_QUEST4_VINYL_DESCRIPTION4",It’s some sort of soundtrack.

"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_MEADOW_MEREDITH",What’s going on now…?
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_MEADOW_EUGENE",That was pretty intense just now…

"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_MEADOW_VIOLA",What trickery is afoot now?

"POWER_STATION_NOTE1",“10/10/1957 0400
Stayed up all night with Dr Aegle and Dr Aetheria, designing new experiments to run in the fusion reactor. We really got into the flow of it and lost track of time – for a while it felt like we were one singular entity focused on the reactor!”
"POWER_STATION_NOTE2",“10/10/1957 0515
Something odd is going on in the reactor – the temperature in the core keeps rising! We’ve turned on the cooling fans to increase airflow, but it hasn’t helped! If this keeps up, we’re toast, literally!”
"POWER_STATION_NOTE3",“10/10/1957 0700
A being calling itself ‘Helia’ emerged from the reactor! The thermocouples immediately registered a drop in the core temperature, so… I think it’s safe again now? ‘Helia’ looks sort of like a diagram of a helium atom, with the two rings representing electron orbits...”
"POWER_STATION_NOTE4",“10/10/1957 0730
‘Helia’ tells us that we somehow created her, or summoned her? She’s now explaining how to make our reactor workable. And afterwards she wants to talk to us about other kinds of fusion… What other kinds?!”
"POWER_STATION_NOTE5",“11/10/1957 0305
We followed Helia’s suggestions to combine Folklord, Masquerattle, Manispear, and REDACTED, which the Ministry of Supply sourced for us from a local zoo. Helia seems dissatisfied with the result – was this not what she wanted? Are we supposed to have used live beasts?”
"POWER_STATION_NOTE6",“11/10/1957 0800
What have we done!? The unstable fusion is out of control! It keeps duplicating!! The ministry has sealed the building to keep it in, and I’m stuck inside! Mer-Line help me!”
"POWER_STATION_DREADFUL7_OPTION1",Let’s do it!
"POWER_STATION_DREADFUL7_OPTION2",Let’s wait.

"MAGIKRAB_PLATFORMB_ROBIN1",We had an arrival at Platform B a short while ago.
"MAGIKRAB_PLATFORMB_CUBE1",The guest arriving at Platform B has many sharp edges. My advice would be to keep your distance.
"WATERLOOP_LYING_CHEST_LEFTMOST",A note on this locker says, “the key is in this box”. Open it?
"WATERLOOP_LYING_CHEST_MIDDLE",A note on this locker says, “the key is not in the leftmost box”. Open it?
"WATERLOOP_LYING_CHEST_RIGHTMOST",A note on this locker says, “the key is not in this box”. Open it?

"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_WATERLOOP_KAYLEIGH",I wonder where that water is coming from…
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_WATERLOOP_MEREDITH",There’s water down here? Where is it coming from?
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_WATERLOOP_EUGENE",A canal, huh? I wonder where the water is flowing from?
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_WATERLOOP_FELIX",Is that water flowing from the surface, or somewhere else?
"PASSIVE_DUNGEON_WATERLOOP_VIOLA",A stream… Perhaps we could find its source?
"HARBOURTOWN_FLORIST_NAME",Anxious Ranger

"HARBOURTOWN_KAYLEIGH9",Yep! I’d say the town is looking a wee bit prettier now!
"HARBOURTOWN_MEREDITH9",Yeah, we successfully raised the town’s “twee” rating by a few points.
"HARBOURTOWN_FELIX9",I think it’s fair to say that the town is looking a little nicer now.

"HARBOURTOWN_FLORIST1",Pardon me, but are you involved with the rangers?
"HARBOURTOWN_FLORIST1_OPTION1",Yeah!
"HARBOURTOWN_FLORIST2",OK! Wonderful! I’m a [wave amp=30 freq=10]fellow ranger[/wave] – well, a trainee at least. Perhaps you could lend me a hand?
"HARBOURTOWN_FLORIST4",However, I’m… not great at decision making. Which plants would look best? It’s too much!
"HARBOURTOWN_FLORIST5",Would you help a fellow ranger out and put some saplings in the planters I’ve left around town?
"HARBOURTOWN_FLORIST5_OPTION1",Sure!
"HARBOURTOWN_FLORIST6",Thank you! Here, take these…

"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_22_DIALOGUE1",We [wave amp=30 freq=10]usually[/wave] cook food for the townsfolk here, but we haven’t received ingredients from the farm west of here for a while. I wonder what’s going on?

"HARBOURTOWN_BOOTLEG_NPC2",Yeah.[pause] Have you ever seen a monster in your travels that isn’t its normal colour? That’s a bootleg.[pause] But don’t confuse it with a coating!

"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_20_DIALOGUE1",I know that transforming is way more effective in battle, but...
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_15_DIALOGUE1",Harbourtown has always had some sort of “community volunteer” group. [pause]How else would it have stayed in one piece so long?

"PASSIVE_OVERWORLD_2_0_EUGENE",This is a pretty good spot to do some push ups!
"PASSIVE_OVERWORLD_2_0_FELIX",This is a nice and quiet spot if you ignore the giant crab monsters.

"END_MIRROR_DENIAL_MEREDITH1",I… can’t go through here just yet, {player}. It looks like it might be a one-way trip, and I’ve got unfinished business.

"TRAVELING_MERCHANT_INTRO2",Nope, I’m certain I’d remember a face like yours.
"TRAVELING_MERCHANT_REPEAT_MEET",Fancy running into you here!
"TRAVELING_MERCHANT_POST_TRADE1",Hoo boy, the lack of money in these parts sure makes things difficult.

"VIN_PART4_VIN2",Uhh... 
"VIN_PART4_VIN3",That thing ambushed me...
"VIN_PART4_VIN5_OPTION1",You’re mistaken!
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE6",[shake rate=30 level=10]Vin!?[/shake] [pause]You’re behind all this?
"VIN_PART4_VIN8",Set…[pause] aside…[pause] for the commune?[pause] Our commune?
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE9",Yes, you idiot!
"VIN_PART4_VIN10",But the rangers… They took control, right? Coerced you,[pause] and stuff?
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE11",Not at all. Dorian’s death was an awakening for me.
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE12",When he was with us – when he was [wave amp=30 freq=10]in charge[/wave] – it was like living under a spell. I couldn’t recognise what was happening around me for what it was.
"VIN_PART4_KAYLEIGH14",Jacqueline...
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE15",I sought out help for the commune, and Ianthe was kind enough to provide it.
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE16",You know, we’d be starving by now if not for her support. Dorian had us dig up our vegetable patch to get to that Archangel!
"VIN_PART4_VIN17",...
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE18",Come on, let’s get you home so you can rest up.
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE19",{player}, [pause]I’m so, so sorry.
"VIN_PART4_JACQUELINE22",Please let Ianthe know how grateful I am to have her support.
"VIN_PART4_VIN1",Just leave me…
"HARBOURTOWN_ASTROLOGER_NAME",Astrologer
"HARBOURTOWN_ASTROLOGER_NPC1",[wave amp=30 freq=10]Welcome, enquiring souls![/wave] Are you here to learn about the astral arts?
"HARBOURTOWN_ASTROLOGER_NPC1_OPTION1",Sure!
"HARBOURTOWN_ASTROLOGER_NPC3",Excellent… [pause]you would be wise to heed my words!
"HARBOURTOWN_ASTROLOGER_NPC6",However, their internal harmony can be thrown into [wave amp=30 freq=10]disarray[/wave] by exposure to impure elements: plastic, poison and metal. 
"HARBOURTOWN_ASTROLOGER_NPC2",Another time, perhaps!
"POWER_STATION_DREADFUL6",You take a look around – I need to catch my breath.
"FARM_MARIS_INTERACT",Hello! [pause]It is nice of you to visit us out here. [pause]Are you staying for a while, or just passing through?
"GRAVEYARD_GHOST_BOY_NAME",Ghost Boy
"GRAVEYARD_GHOST_BOY_PRE_BATTLE1",Uh-oh! A ghost!
"GRAVEYARD_GHOST_BOY_POST_BATTLE1",Oh, sorry! There’s a rumour of a ghost around here, and I thought it was you.
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_12_DIALOGUE9",I might be here forever, but at least things are never [wave amp=30 freq=10]boring[/wave].
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_12_DIALOGUE8",Apparently the bridge that connects Harbourtown to Piper Farm has been lowered again. That’s [wave amp=30 freq=10]great[/wave] news for everyone here who, [pause]well, [pause]needs food to live.
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_12_DIALOGUE7",I haven’t seen those creepy pale folks in the black suits recently. What happened to them?
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_12_DIALOGUE6",Folks around town claim that the abandoned mall is [wave amp=30 freq=10]haunted[/wave]. Monsters are one thing, but I draw the line at believing in ghosts!
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_12_DIALOGUE5",Apparently Harbourtown and that other town in the east have made amends. I wonder what happened?
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_12_DIALOGUE4",Have you seen those cloaked weirdos around the park? Are they part of a [wave amp=30 freq=10]theatre troupe[/wave] or something?
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_12_DIALOGUE3",Some weird pale skinned folks were skulking around here recently, muttering under their breaths. That’s unusual, even for this place.
"HARBOURTOWN_NPC_12_DIALOGUE1",You know what I miss? [pause]Sports. [pause]Why can’t Harbourtown start a football team?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_EUGENE2",I think it’s fair to say {player} and I both share the role of “hero” [wave amp=30 freq=10]pretty[/wave] equally.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_FELIX2",This conversation’s off to an enigmatic start. Please continue.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_VIOLA2",Speak plainly, if you will.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_KAYLEIGH7",Please don’t take this the wrong way, but you seemed [wave amp=30 freq=10]pretty[/wave] tough for a human. You’re not an… Archangel, are you?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_MEREDITH7",I don’t think human beings can fight [wave amp=30 freq=10]that[/wave] well. Spills the beans – you’re an Archangel, aren’t you?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_EUGENE7",Hey, [pause]don’t play dumb with us – you’re an Archangel, right? No regular human is that strong!
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_FELIX7",I’m just going to come out and say it – you’re an Archangel, aren’t you? I got “Archangel” vibes from that fight just now.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_VIOLA7",I think you are not being truthful with us, “Lenna”.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_7_OPTION1",Are you an Archangel, Lenna?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_LENNA8",I am. Well, I used to be. I guess I still am. [pause]It’s a long story.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_LENNA9_OPTION1",You can do that…?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_LENNA10",Why not? [pause]We’re not bound by our origins – it doesn’t matter who we [wave amp=30 freq=10]used[/wave] to be, it only matters who we choose to be in the present.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_KAYLEIGH11",Right! I’m [wave amp=30 freq=10]totally[/wave] with you on that!
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_MEREDITH11",Huh. I guess that checks out. 
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_EUGENE11",That makes sense. I can’t fault you for who you are.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_FELIX11",I totally agree.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_VIOLA11",Yes – I am inclined to agree.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_LENNA12",You wouldn’t believe it, but I’m actually a [wave amp=30 freq=10]school teacher[/wave]. My assignment here was to test you, and you just passed your examination with flying colours!
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_LENNA13_OPTION1",I’m {player}!
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_LENNA15",Well, I should go now. Ms. Amber promised me a ride home once I was done here, and I told Paige I wouldn’t be gone [wave amp=30 freq=10]too[/wave] long.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_KAYLEIGH16",Oh! Ms. Amber sure seems to know a lot of people, huh…?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_MEREDITH16",Oh, OK. You’re just here on New Wirral for a brief visit, then?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_EUGENE16",What?! You’re just here on New Wirral on an [wave amp=30 freq=10]errand[/wave]?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_FELIX16",You came to New Wirral purely on an assignment? That’s really something.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_VIOLA16",I can see you long to return to your loved ones also! Do not let us keep you.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_LENNA17",Until we meet again, {player}!
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_KAYLEIGH18",A lot of interesting people seem to find their way to this island, don’t they?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_MEREDITH18",Damn, I didn’t get time to ask her if those were real horns on her head or just her hair.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_EUGENE18",I bet she thought I was “hero material” too… she just forgot to say it out loud.
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_FELIX18",There’s never a dull moment on this island, is there?
"LENNA_ENCOUNTER_VIOLA18",Farewell, Lenna of the Unknown Realm. 
"MAGIKRAB_UNKNOWN_NAME",Traffi... krab?
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_KRAB1",Aha, {player}! And {partner}! I've been waiting for you.
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_KAYLEIGH2",Did... Did that Traffikrab just speak?
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_MEREDITH2",Huh? A talking Traffikrab?
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_EUGENE2",I don't fear you Traffikrab! I've fought many of your kind before!
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_FELIX2",Wait, Traffikrabs can talk?
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_VIOLA2",This Traffikrab speaks? What manner of...
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_DOG2",Arf!
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_KRAB3",Please, do not liken me to the mindless Traffikrabs out there.
"MAGIKRAB_INTRO_KRAB4",I am Magikrab, indentured servant to the infinite Mer-Line: long may Their trains run on time!
"MAGIKRAB_MENU",Now, what can I do for you {player}?
"MAGIKRAB_MENU_OPTION_TRAVEL",I want to travel.
"MAGIKRAB_TRAVEL1",Where do you want to go?
"MAGIKRAB_TRAVEL2",The train at Platform A is ready for departure, {player}.
"MAGIKRAB_TRAVEL3",Mind the gap!
"MAGIKRAB_LEAVE_FINAL_STATION1",Well, you’re in the right place! Please proceed to Platform B.
"MAGIKRAB_LEAVE1",Well, Platform B is what we use for interdimensional travel...
"MAGIKRAB_MERLINE1",That’s right! The Mer-Line is an underground network of railway stations all across New Wirral, and some distance beyond!
"MAGIKRAB_MAGIKRAB1",Indeed! I am Magikrab, indentured servant to the incomparable Mer-Line, in whose halls you now stand.
"MAGIKRAB_NOTHING1",Very well!

"SOCRATES_PRE_BATTLE",The perfect human being is all human beings put together. It is a collective; it is all of us together that make perfection.
"PLATO_PRE_BATTLE",I exhort you also to take part in the great combat, which is the combat of life, and greater than every other earthly conflict!
"SOCRATES_POST_BATTLE",Thank you. I thought that I could beat you. Now I am truly wise, because now I know that I know nothing.
"PLATO_POST_BATTLE",We are philosophers, Socrates, not fighters. Hardly any human being is capable of pursuing two professions or two arts rightly.
