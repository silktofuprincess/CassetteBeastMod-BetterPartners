[wave amp=30 freq=10]So…[/wave] [pause]You and Meredith, [pause]huh?
	You heard…?
	I hope it’s not awkward…
I guess after we [wave amp=30 freq=10]kissed[/wave], maybe I just had the wrong impression of what “we” were.
It's OK! It's not like you promised me anything, Kylie. We had a cute moment together, that's all.
You and Meredith get on well, though. I can totally see you two together.
A word of advice between friends, though -[pause] maybe you [wave amp=30 freq=10]shouldn’t[/wave] tell her she’s not the only girl on this island that you’ve kissed.


So I heard Kayleigh is like, your girlfriend now…?
What can I say? Word gets around. 
I mean I don’t blame you – [pause]I mean, Kayleigh is [wave amp=30 freq=10]Kayleigh[/wave].
She’s effortlessly perfect, and gorgeous too. [pause]Don’t tell her I said that.
(God, I’m such a [wave amp=30 freq=10]mess[/wave] when talking to women...)
Maybe I just got the wrong idea after that night we spent together… [pause]but it’s OK.
I’m not sure I’m ready for any long-term commitments anyway, mate.
